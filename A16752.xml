            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Deſiring hereby to teſtifie my ſpeciall thankfulneſſe to ye both, and to helpe both you and yours, and as many others as I might in the right way of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>Howe worthie a teſtimonie of ſuch my ſpeciall thankfulneſſe to you my ſo right worſhipfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall good Patrons, as I haue found ye to be vnto me; and conſequently how worthie your credit and protection, and how profitable a helpe to further ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſelues or any other in the way of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and chiefly how this booke may be to the glory of God, which aboue all things ought to be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in euery enterpriſe we take in hand, I leaue it to be determined by that gracious bleſſing which God himſelfe of his infinite goodneſſe and mercie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne diuine counſell and wiſedome, ſhall vouchſafe to giue vnto it.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe ſeeing I do preſent to you an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that part of the moſt excellent Lawe of the Lord our God, which containeth the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall rule and ground of all true wiſedome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe before him; and therewith alſo a manifold collection of diuerſe neceſſarie and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcourſes incident to the ſame, from the reſt
<pb facs="tcp:182:3"/> of the holy Scripturs of God: ſuch as are the equitie of the ſame moſt holy and righteous Law; the curſes threatened againſt the trangreſſions thereof; the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed to all perfect obedience, not onely in generall, but alſo concerning euery particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lawe; with a declaration likewiſe of the onely perfect obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt to all and euery commandement; and of our owne perfect diſobedience, as well in corruption of nature, as in error and tranſgreſſion of life, vntil we be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt, and ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt: as alſo after we are ſo ingrafted, ſanctified and renued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that our obedience at the beſt, is onely (as we may ſay) inchoate and but begunne, alwayes in this life remaining ſtill vnperfect; ſo that it is of grace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and not by worth and merite, that either it or our ſelues are accepted with God. Finally, ſeeing the excellent vſes of the Law of God in all theſe reſpects, are here preſented vnto you, and that in ſuch ſort, as all theſe points haue not bene ſo fully gathered together, as it were many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours into one, as, by the grace of God, ye ſhall find them here gathered and ſorted to your hands, all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to inſtruct vs to true humiliation in our ſelues, that we might moſt happily reioyce and glorie in the Lord, and be partakers of his glorie in the end. I haue now good hope vpon the premiſes, that with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable conſtruction of al things, and without iuſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to anie other, I may in ſuch modeſtie as may well beſeeme an humble ſeruant of God, deſire ye to eſteeme this booke, as worthie for the Lords cauſe, not onely that countenance and ſafegard which your worthie names and credite may procure it, but alſo
<pb facs="tcp:182:4"/> your verie diligent and carefull reading, peruſing and pondering of it; as that treaſure which God would haue in ſpeciall manner weighed out, tendered, and appropriated to you.</p>
            <p>I beſeech ye therefore, right Worſhipfull in the Lord, receiue ye this writing, not ſo much from me vnworthie poore wretch, as from the gracious good hand of God, who hath (as I truſt) prepared and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it from the treaſurie of his riches, for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall inriching of your ſoules to his heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as a fruite and bleſſing vpon you, for your ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fauour to me, and other his ſeruants for his ſake; how frayle and earthen ſoeuer the inſtrument is, which it hath pleaſed him to vſe in this miniſterie &amp; ſeruice toward you. And for the ſame cauſe alſo do I humbly beſeech ye, to make the beſt ſpirituall gaine of it, to the vttermoſt of that, wherunto it may poſſibly be improued by you.</p>
            <p>To this end, as I began, ſo do I ſtill, and by Gods grace ſhall ſo long as I liue, as humbly and inſtantly as I ſhall be able, beſeech God our heauenly father, who onely hath the full treaſurie of ſpirituall riches, fully ſufficient for all that be his; that it may pleaſe him of his bounteous mercy, more and more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh you and yours, with all heauenly graces, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and comforts, vntill ye may together with the reſt of his Saints, attaine to his euerlaſting kingdome of glorie, euen for his moſt deare ſonne our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his ſake, of whoſe fulneſſe onely we muſt all receiue, euen grace after grace, whatſoeuer we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is Catechiſme, I meane as touching the Chriſtian exerciſe and practiſe thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Chriſtian exerciſe of Catechiſme is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, plaine and orderly teaching of the grounds and principles of Chriſtian religion by word of mouth from the holy Scriptures of God, with requiring an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that which hath bene taught, by queſtioning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with the hearers from point to point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Catechiſe is, according to the ſignification of the Greek word <hi>Catechaeoo,</hi> to teach by ſound of voice.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Of the later part of the which Greeke word commeth the word <hi>eccho,</hi> familiar in our Engliſh tong, which ſignifieth a reſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the voice.</p>
            <p>This word of Catechiſing is vſed generally for all kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by heare-ſay, as we vſe to ſpeake. Act. 21.21.24.</p>
            <p>It is vſed for preaching of the word, whether by continued oration, or by this breaking off or diuiſion of ſpeech, by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and anſwer. Gal. 6.6. <hi>Let him</hi> (ſaith the holy Apoſtle) <hi>who is taught in the word, make him that hath taught him partaker of all his goods.</hi> The Greeke word there vſed is this of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as though we ſhould reade it thus: Let him that is Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe Act. 18.25. and Rom. 2.18. and 1. Cor. 14.19. I had rather ſpeake fiue words that I might be vnderſtood and inſtruct (or as the Greeke word is) catechiſe others, then ten thouſand words in a ſtrange tongue. Reade alſo Luke 1.4. For as much as many haue taken in hand, &amp;c. It ſeemed good alſo to me (moſt noble Theophilus &amp;c.) to write vnto thee thereof

And 2. Tim. 1.13. he compareth it to a patterne, the worke of a skilfull and expert painter or drawer, which ſetteth out that which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, by a full and liuely pourtraiture.</p>
            <p>It is compared alſo to feeding with milk, &amp; not with ſtrong meate, Heb. 5.12.13.14. and to the laying of the foundation of a building, as it followeth in the next chapter of the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, verſes 1.2. Of this building Chriſt onely is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea the whole building ariſeth to perfection in him 1. Cor. 3.11. and Epheſ. 4.11.12.13. And therefore alſo all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Chriſtian catechiſing is to be fetched from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, ſeeing they alone as Chriſt him ſelf ſaith of them, do truly teſtifie of him. Ioh. 5.39.</p>
            <p>The practiſe or exerciſe of Catechiſme is either in a more large or ſhorter maner: but the largeſt Catechiſme muſt be an abridging as it were and contracting of the whole Scriptures of God, for the more eaſie and readie helpe of the learner.</p>
            <p>Conference by wiſe and diſcreete queſtioning and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about any one point is verie profitable; for it diſcouereth the ſecret error and ignorance of a mans iudgement, it layeth open the euill luſt and affection of the heart, yea through the bleſſing of God it enformeth the iudgement, it reformeth and bettereth the affection, it quickeneth both iudgement and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the actions and duties of a godly life, according to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:182:7"/> the particulars which are conferred vpon.<note place="margin">The reaſons of this exerciſe.</note> How much more profitable then muſt not a more generall and orderlie confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proue in proceſſe of time? And thus we ſee what Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing is: and that there is great profit in the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>But ſhew you more fullie as you haue bene further taught what the reaſons are why this exerciſe of Catechiſing ſhould be in vſe among the people of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt reaſon may iuſtly be the commandement of God, who requireth it as a ſpeciall fruite of that pure, feruent and constant loue, which we do moſt boundenly owe vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondlie, the loue which all Chriſtians ought to beare to their children, euen for the Lordes ſake; to the end they may be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to deliuer them from their naturall ignorance &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe, to preſerue them from errors and hereſies, yea from the euerlaſting destruction of their ſoules, ſpeciallie in theſe laſt and moſt daungerous dayes, wherein all iniquitie both of doctrine and life doth exceedinglie abound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the care which all ought to haue for the propagation of the truth of holie doctrine, and of the practiſe of Gods pure worſhip to poſteritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, the example of the true Churches of God, both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter, in the moſt pure times of the worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finallie, the bleſſing of God, which alwayes accompanieth this holie care of planting, cheriſhing and propagating the ſame true knowledge and worſhip of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to whet or ſharpen as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do their arrow heads or other weapons &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, that they may more eaſily pierce &amp; enter: as Deut. 32.41. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of commeth Scheminah for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeach or talke: as Deut. 28.37. &amp; 1. King. 9.7. and 2. Chron. 7.20. ioyned with Maſchal a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe as Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma.</note> 
               <hi>as on the contrary his heauy curſe &amp; vengeance, which falleth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all corrupters or deſpiſers therof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the commandement of God, read Deut. ch. 6. verſes. 4.5.6.7.8. and chap. 11.18.19.20.21. In the former of the which places ver. 7. the Hebrew word <hi>Schanan</hi> Engliſhed to rehearſe, ſignifieth properlie to whet, noting and implying thereby ſuch a rehearſing of the commandements of God vnto children, as by the ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> applying of them to their capacitie they may moſt commodiouſlie enter and take place in their hearts. The which can no way better be done then by an orderly &amp; familiar que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning with them vpon the ſame. Read alſo Pſal. 78.1.2.3. &amp; Ezek. 16.20.21. where the Lord vehementlie reproueth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for their vnfaithfulneſſe to him in the wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie education of their children.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:182:8"/>
            <p>Touching the loue which all Chriſtian Parents ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe toward their children, this way aboue all other; reade Epheſ. 6.4. And for a liuely patterne of this loue behold dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie how the practiſe of it is repreſented in the whole booke of the holie Prouerbes of king Salomon. The neceſſitie whereof is alſo in that booke notablie declared in manie places; becauſe fooliſhneſſe is naturallie bound in the heart of euerie child, and becauſe they are in further daunger to be hardened and made more bold vnto ſinne by the example and incouragement of ill companie, ſuch as ſeeke to corrupt youth, &amp;c. Neither doth the Lord ordinarilie ſaue any that come to yeares of diſcretion but by meanes of Catechiſing and inſtruction, whereby they come to that knowledge which is vnto ſaluation. Iohn. 17.3.</p>
            <p>Now for the care of propagating the true Religion of God to poſteritie, that it ought to be in all Parents and proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, reade Geneſ. 18. verſes. 18.19. where we haue the verie memorable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Abraham the father of al the faithful. Read alſo Deut. 4.9.10. the commandement of God.<note place="margin">Symphoriſſa with her 7. chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the 3. perſecution. Likewiſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia with her three children. Felicitas with her 7. children in the 4. perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. A woman of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria with her two daughters in the 10. perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. A woman of Antioch with her litle child, who anſwered the tyrant, that he had learned religion from his mothers breaſts. Athanaſia with her 3. daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c. Read in M. Foxe Actes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</note> And Pſal 78.5.6.7. In which place euen from the beginning of the Pſalme, we haue a further teſtimonie of that example wherein the auncient Church of God among the Iewes hath gone before vs.</p>
            <p>And for later times, read. 2. Tim. 1.5. and ch. 3.15. and Heb. ch. 5.12.13.14. and ch. 6.1.2. Neither after this, could the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs euen holie women in time of perſecution haue prepared &amp; animated their children, yea euen their tender daughters to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with them verie cruell torments, had they not bene dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euen from the breaſts as it were, to haue Catechiſed and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in the knowledge and faith of the truth of God. And now laſt of all, ſince the breaking forth of the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the black cloud of Popiſh ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, all Churches reformed are in this point notable examples for their mutuall comfort, and ſo ſhall remaine to prouoke all Gods children to the end of the world, to be worthie Imitators and followers of them. In which reſpect Caluin that worthy inſtrument of God in his Commentarie vpon the 22. Pſal. vpon theſe words verſ. 30.31. The ſeede (both of high and low) ſhall ſerue the Lord: it ſhall be counted (vnto him) for a generation. They ſhall come and ſhall declare his righteouſneſſe vnto a people that ſhall be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:182:8"/> borne, becauſe he hath done it: he gathereth this excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the care and indeuour of propagating true doctrine is inioyned vnto vs,<note place="margin">Cura &amp; ſtudium propagandae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae doctrine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis iniungitur, quo poſt mortem noſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuperſtes maneat. Nam quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoc pijs om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus commune tribuat officium ſpiritus ſanctus operam dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituendis liberis, vt noua ſoboles ad Deum colen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſisccedat; ſummae turpitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis damnatur eorum ignauia, quibus Dei me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam aeterno ſilentio obruere nulla religio eſt: vt per eos non ſtet quò minus intercidat. Promiſcuè mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur omnes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peram hanc gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimam eſſe Deo, ſi nomen eius tranſmitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſtudeant ad aetates futuras.</note> to the end it may continue and (as it were) ſuruiue vs, after that we be dead. For (as he ſaith further) in ſo much as the holie Ghoſt layeth this as a common charge vpon all that are godlie minded, that they be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in teaching their children, to the end a new of-ſpring may ſucceede in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Gods worſhip: moſt ſhamefull is their lubberiſhneſſe, who are ſo profane, that they care not though the memoriall of God be for euer ſuppreſſed, and that for any thing they will do, it ſhould be ſo farre from continuance, that it ſhould vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall away.</p>
            <p>And Pſal. 78. vpon the 5. and 6. verſes: he doth likewiſe very worthilie obſerue, that from theſe wordes of the Pſalme, (God hath commanded that fathers ſhould teach their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That the poſteritie might know his Law, &amp; the children which ſhold be borne ſhould ſtand vp and declare it to their children &amp;c.) All (ſaith he) are generallie aduertiſed, that they performe a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moſt acceptable to God, whoſoeuer do carefullie indeuour to ſet ouer his name, (that is to make him trulie knowne) to the ages to come.</p>
            <p>Finally, as touching the laſt point of the anſwer, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bleſſing of God following this carefull indeuour: read Deut. 28.1. &amp;c. 14. Read alſo Pſal. 67. and Iohn. 9.31.1. Tim. 4.8. There are many ſuch like teſtimonies. And on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie for Gods curſe vpon the neglect hereof: reade againe Deut. 28. verſes. 15.16. &amp;c. &amp; Pſal. 78. from the 8. ver. There are likewiſe many other ſuch like places of holie Scripture. Yea examples alſo of Gods fearefull iudgements. 2. King. chap. 2.23.24. and chap. 17. of the ſame booke. And Pſal. 106.37.38. &amp;c. But theſe for the preſent ſhall ſuffice. Let vs now proceede.</p>
            <p>Which are the parts or moſt generall heads and grounds of Chriſtian Catechiſme?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe two: the morall Law or ten Commandements of almightie God, and the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for the morall Law or ten Commandements, they are a brief ſum of the old Teſtament, in ſo much as the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and iudiciall lawes of God are but as it were appendices
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:182:9"/> or appurtenances to thoſe which are morall.<note place="margin">The parts.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And the Goſpell, that is to ſay, the glad tidings of ſaluation, containing the Articles of our Chriſtian faith, it is as one may ſay an abridgement of the New Teſtament. Whereunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the doctrine of the Sacraments, which are as ſignes and ſeales annexed to the Goſpell, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We begin with the Law of God, not that we hold it the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right and neceſſarie courſe of Catechiſing. For God as it pleaſeth him doth ſomtime enlighten, call and renew thoſe that be his, not by humbling or caſting them down at the firſt, as he did Saul, &amp; as we reade of Martin Luther &amp;c. by the terrors of the law in the ſight of their ſinnes, and of that horrible damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vengeance due to the ſame; but by giuing them (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are grieuous ſinners) a comfortable ſight and ſweet taſt and feeling in the apprehenſion of his rich and tender mercies, touching forgiueneſſe of ſinnes through Ieſus Chriſt. And accordingly is the doctrine diuerſly fitted and diſpoſed in the holie Scriptures themſelues. For ſometime the inſtruction proceedeth from the diſcouery of ſinne &amp; of the corruption of nature, as God dealeth with Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the beginning, &amp; our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt with Nicodemus in the Goſpell, &amp; Paul in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Romans: ſometime from the bleſſings, as God with Abraham, and Paul to the Epheſians, ſomtime from the curſe, as Iacob with his ſonnes at his death: ſometime fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and expreſly, as Leuit. chap. 26. and Deut. chap. 27, and chap. 28. or at the leaſt incluſiuely, as Iohn the Baptiſt &amp; our Sauiour Chriſt: Repent &amp; amend, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, let vs wiſely marke, &amp; we ſhall ſee that which way ſoeuer God giueth an entrance into his kingdome, either by terrour or by comfort, yet he doth afterward ſchoole and nourture them both wayes; he ſometime laying to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences the greatneſſe of their ſinnes and iuſt deſerued miſerie by the rebukes of the Law, &amp; ſo driueth them to Chriſt &amp; the comfortes of the Goſpell; &amp; then againe from Chriſt in whom their ſoules are refreſhed, to more care and conſcience of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dutie then before, in obedience to Gods Law, leaſt comfort ſhould hide it ſelfe, and trouble and diſcomfort ſhould returne more vncomfortably then before. So that we our ſelues ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:182:9"/> finde by experience that there is a continuall and neceſſarie vſe ſucceſsiuelie both of the law and alſo of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Queſtions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratorie to the Law.</note> partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the dulneſſe &amp; hardneſſe of our hearts, leaſt we ſhould waxe wanton againſt the Lord and profane his mercies; and partly becauſe of the weakeneſſe of our faith and failings in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: leaſt we ſhould be driuen to diſpaire of Gods mercy, beholding the ſtrictneſſe and perfection of his glorious iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And yet, ſeeing humiliation by the Law is for the ordinarie courſe more fit for vs, howſoeuer the ioy of the Goſpell is more agreeable to the bountie of Gods grace and mercie: and ſeeing Chriſt came not to call the righteous but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; therefore ſaith, Come vnto me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and laden: therefore let vs hold our purpoſe to make our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the doctrine of Catechiſme from the law. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof ſhal yet further appeare hereafter; yet ſo, as by the grace of God we will neuer be contentious herein.</p>
            <p>In the meane while let vs conſider of the anſwers to certaine queſtions profitable to prepare the way thereunto, as alſo to the whole doctrine of Catechiſme.</p>
            <p>I demaunde therfore firſt, what euerie one of vs ought both firſt of all in order of time as moſt neceſſarie, and chiefly alſo as being moſt worthy aboue all other things, to ſeeke and labour after all the dayes of this ſhort and tranſitorie life of ours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rightly to know, beleeue, loue, feare, ſerue and worſhip God in Chriſt Ieſus, to the glorifying of his name in this preſent euill world, that we may be glorified of him and with him for euer in his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly kingdome in the world to come.</hi>

               <hi>The orderly courſe of the holy Storie, how one thing followeth another in order of time, and therein chiefly how both the Lavv of Moſes, and alſo all the reſt of the Prophets, do giue one concordable and conſonant witneſſe vnto Ieſus Christ: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his nature, his tribe, his perſon, his office, by doctrine, types, figures, and propheſies.

               <hi>Yes: for beſide the doctrine of faith, and the vndoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, we are vvith like diligence and reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to marke all holy inſtructions for good life, with the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all kindes of bleſſings belonging thereunto: and likewiſe all warnings againſt ſinne and the threatnings thereof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal alſo the good examples of the godly, and their bleſſed ends, for our incouragement, to liue as they haue liued: and the euill examples of the vvicked, and their curſed ends, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid their wayes.</hi>

            <p>Theſe things indeede are verie good and neceſſarie to be obſerued in the reading of the holy Scriptures: but here a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or doubt ariſeth: If the holy Scriptures onely be able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, and to guide vs in the right way of glorifying God: what is to be thought of other good books and godly writings, whether we enquire of thoſe which be called Apochripha vſually bound in our Bibles, or anie other written by godly and learned men heretofore, or now laſt of all in theſe our dayes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They may be greatly profitable, as helps for our weakeneſſe, if good diſcretion be vſed in reading of them: that is, if too much time be not ſpent that way from the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues; and if we trie all other vvritings by the holy Scriptures, which alone in matters of ſaluation haue authoritie and credit of themſelues, and no other further then they do agree with them, and ſo haue allowance from them.

               <hi>No, but as the Lord at the firſt, and ſo from time to time, choſe and ſanctified ſome ſpeciall men, vvhome it pleaſed him to vſe as his holy inſtruments to vvrite dovvne his Scriptures once for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: ſo it is and alvvayes hath bene his pleaſure to call and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh many other vvith vnderſtanding, and vvith the gift of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and exhorting aboue the reſt, to miniſter a more cleare &amp; full light of his heauenly knovvledge vnto his people, and to ſtirre vp and avvake their conſciences to a more effectuall embracing of the ſame, then they could by their ovvne reading attaine vnto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is manifeſtly to be ſeene euerie where in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Lord by his holy Prophets calleth for hearing, as the moſt effectual meanes of knowledge, faith, and obedience.</p>
            <p>So doth King Salomon throughout the booke of the holy Prouerbes. So doth our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell, Matth. 13.9.16.17.18. and in the Reuelation, Chap. 2. chap. and 3.</p>
            <p>It followeth therefore that with like reuerence, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſpeciall neceſſitie, that we acquaint our ſelues with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearing of the Scriptures, preached and taught in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie thereof.</p>
            <p>Further, it is neceſſarie that they be carefully meditated v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in euerie of our hearts, apart by our ſelues, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred of one with another both publikely and priuately.</p>

            <p>It is very true: neither was there any time ſince that any part of the holy Scriptures were written, wherein all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God haue not had a moſt religious reſpect vnto them: the Prophets to the Law, Chriſt to the Prophets, the Apoſtles to Chriſt, and all the faithfull Paſtors and Doctors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, to the Apoſtles and to Chriſt, and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to the Law of God giuen by Moſes, and to all the reſt of Moſes writings, reade Luke 16.29.30.31. and Coloſ. 2.18, &amp;c. and 1. Tim. 4.7. All antiquity not agreeing with the word of God, is to be accounted no better then an old wiues fable. Finally reade Gal. 1.8.9: Though that we or an Angell from heauen, &amp;c. But after that we haue read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, meditated and conferred of them: yea, after that we haue heard them plainly opened and interpreted by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters and Preachers thereof: can we then by the light and ſharpneſſe of our owne naturall and mother wit (as we call it) ſufficiently vnderſtand the Scriptures, to the glorifying of God, and obtayning of our ſaluation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We cannot, vnleſſe it pleaſe God, together with his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or written word, and the outward exerciſes thereof, to giue vs alſo his holy Spirit; whereby they may be inwardly written in our hearts, as it were by the finger thereof. For ſo our Sauiour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:182:15"/> Chriſt earneſtly affirmeth, in the third Chapter of Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reading and hearing of the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit.</note> 
               <hi>ſpeaking thus to Nicodemus: Verily, verily, I ſay vnto thee, except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God. And againe, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto thee, except a man be borne againe of water and of the Spirite, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by many other authorities of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</p>
            <p>But let vs proceed: After that we are enlightened by the Spirit of God, through the reading and hearing of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preached vnto vs, ſo that we do in ſome meaſure know the right way to ſaluation, and how God is to be glorified: haue we thenceforth any power, good-will, and affection of our ſelues, to lay hold thereon, to our owne comfort, and to prouoke our ſelues to walke dutifully in the conſtant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame, to the honour and prayſe of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No neither: vnleſſe it pleaſe the Lord vnto the enlightening of our minds, to adde a ſecond grace of the ſame his holy Spirit, which is the renewing of the heart, for as the Apoſtle Paul ſaith in the</hi> 2. <hi>Chapter to the Philippians: It is God which worketh in vs both the vvill and the deed, euen of his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tell me now; Are we in any danger ſo long as we remaine in the ignorance of the holy Scriptures of God, albeit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our owne opinion, we haue a good meaning, and do zealouſly ſerue God, after our owne blind deuotion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no doubt but we are in very great and certaine dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the wrath of God, ſo long time as we ſo abide: ſpecially if we deſpiſe wiſedome and inſtruction, as we reade in the firſt Chapter of the Prouerbs of King Salomon, verſe</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;c. And in the firſt Chapter of the</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, from the</hi> 6. <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray you let vs turne to theſe places, and let vs conſider of them.</p>
            <p>Now for ſo much as it ſhall go ſo fearfully with thoſe that be ignorant, and for want of knowledge do not obey the Goſpell: What ſhall we ſay of thoſe who hauing great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo as they can diſcourſe readily vpon all points of the Religion of God, yet haue (for all that) no care nor conſcience
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:182:15"/> to obey his will, but follow their owne wicked luſtes:<note place="margin">Ignorance of the Scriptures damnable, ſo is knowledge without obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> are not all ſuch in a moſt fearfull eſtate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth, that he that knoweth his maiſters will, and prepareth not himſelfe, neither doth according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: Luke Chapter</hi> 12. <hi>the</hi> 47. <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No excellency of knowledge is of any reckning before the Lord, if obedience go not withall, reade Matth. 7.21. &amp;c. and 1. Cor. 13.1. &amp;c. Yet one thing more: Did God create mankind thus ignorant and ſinfull, and miſerable alſo through ſin in the beginning of the creation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, nothing ſo: but wiſe, righteous, holy, and happy, in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of perfection conuenient and meete for them, as it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at large in the firſt and ſecond Chapters of Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for in that it is written that God made mankind according to his ſimilitude and likeneſſe, all which you haue anſwered is comprehended, as we may further perceiue by that we reade Epheſians 4.23.24. and Coloſſ. 3.10. How then came all vanitie and ſinne with ſo great and lamentable confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and miſerie, as it is now come into the world, and is moſt wofully fallen vpon mankind aboue all earthly creatures here below?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is fallen vpon vs all thorough the willing apoſtacy and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away of our firſt parents Adam and Eue, from that holie knowledge, faith, feare, loue, odedience, and happineſſe, wherein the Lord of his infinite goodneſſe had ſet and placed them, they harkening to that lying enticement, and moſt malicious and crafty temptation of the Diuell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is this Diuell you ſpeake of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A wicked ſpirit, who being created of God, a good, holy, &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angel, did not keepe that his firſt eſtate, &amp; the glorious place of his abode, but of his owne accord corrupted himſelfe through ſinne, and many thouſands of the Angels together with himſelfe, and ſo became an enemie to Gods glory, and a moſt wretched de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer and murtherer of mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ground of theſe things haue yee in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ſet foorth and declared at large in the vvhole third
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:182:16"/> Chapter of Geneſis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mans creation by God, his fall of himſelfe by the Diuell.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How ſhould there be any proofe of theſe things, ſpecially touching that which ye anſwere concerning the Diuell in that Chapter: ſeeing, though you reade it throughout, you ſhall find there no expreſſe mention at all made of the Diuell?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That vvhich is vvritten of the Serpent is to be vnderſtood of the Diuell, vvhoſe inſtrument onely the Serpent vvas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwer truly, as may euidently appeare by conference of other places of the holy Scriptures with this third of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: as 2. Cor. 11.3.14. and Reuela. 12.3.4 7.8.9.10.11. and Rom. 16.20. reade alſo Iohn 8.44. and 1. Epiſtle 3.8.10.12. Act. 26.18. 2. Cor. 4.4. Epheſ. 2.2.3. &amp; Chap. 6.12. and 2. Tim. 2.26. and. 1. Pet. 5.8. and finally 2. Pet. 2.4. &amp;c. And in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Iude the 6. verſe. But though Adam and Eue the firſt man and woman fell away from the Lord, &amp; loſt their firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and pulled miſerie vpon themſelues; what proofe haue you that it is ſo likewiſe with all their poſterity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the fift Chapter of the Epistle to the Romanes, verſes</hi> 12.13.14. <hi>in theſe vvords:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) as by one man ſinne entred into the vvorld, and death by ſinne, and ſo death vvent ouer all men, for aſmuch as all haue ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For vnto the time of the Lavv, vvas ſinne in the vvorld. though ſinne is not imputed (or rather not regarded) where there is no Lavv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo death reigned from Adam to Moſes, euen ouer them that ſinned not after the like manner of the tranſgreſſion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, vvho vvas a figure of him that vvas to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place doth plainly confirme it indeed. And it is iuſt with the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, no leſſe then the attainder of the children of a traytour is accounted iuſt with men, vntill the Prince of his clemency &amp; mercy ſhall pardon &amp; reſtore them.</p>
            <p>The iſſue therefore of all is this, that we haue very iuſt and alſo exceeding great cauſe, in godly ſorrow to lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our ſinne, and to turne to the Lord by true repentance, vtterly denying our owne wiſedome, which is nothing but folly, and our owne righteouſneſſe, which is meere iniuſtice, &amp;c. if happily we might find fauour with God, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:182:16"/>
            <p>But haue we of our ſelues due conſcience and remorſe of ſinne ſo to do?<note place="margin">Mans recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue it not: neither can vve poſsibly attaine vnto it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God of his free grace and mercy vouchſafe to giue it: that is, vnleſſe he do by his word and Spirit mightily quicken and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our dead and drouſie conſciences, and alſo mollifie our hard and ſtony hearts. Nay rather, vve bleſſe and thinke our ſelues happie, in putting farre away the conſideration of theſe things from vs, euery one excuſing and iuſtifying himſelfe againſt God, though we go on in neuer ſo vvicked and godleſſe a courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew ſome proofe of this that you ſay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 17. <hi>Chapt. of Ieremie the</hi> 9. <hi>verſe: The heart is decipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vvicked aboue all things, vvho can know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart. And againe Prouerbs</hi> 16.2. <hi>All the vvayes of a man are cleane in his owne eyes, but the Lord pondereth the Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus therefore it is plaine and manifeſt euery way, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we neither know God nor our ſelues aright: and that our corruption, vanitie, ſinne, and miſerie, is aboue all that we can conceiue: ſo that infinite cauſe haue we to renounce our ſelues, and all opinion of our owne wiſdome and goodneſſe, &amp; ſo ſubmit our ſelues to ſeeke our wiſdom from the inſtruction of the word of God, and that our hearts may be renewed by the grace of his holy Spirit, and that we ſhould pray vnto him earneſtly and continually, and vſe all good and holy meanes appointed of God himſelfe to the ſame end, that ſo happily we may be bleſſed of him.</p>
            <p>And ſo come we now after all former queſtions premiſed to the parts of Chriſtian Catechiſme and inſtruction, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the beginning of this our exerciſe, whereunto (as was ſayd) all that hath hitherto bene diſcourſed, hath as it were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the way. Rehearſe the Law or ten Commaundements of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God ſpake all theſe vvords and ſayd, I am the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We begin with the Law, that is, with the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Almighty God, becauſe they are that portion of Scripture, which God hath ſpecially ſanctified to diſcouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:182:17"/> vs,<note place="margin">The Law of God detecteth ſinne, &amp;c.</note> and to cauſe vs in and by his wiſedome to ſee our owne folly; by his holineſſe our prophaneſſe, by his righteouſneſſe our ſinne, and by our ſinne, our owne moſt iuſtly deſerued death and damnation: but not that we ſhould peremptorily and without all bayle and mainepriſe (as we may ſay) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but rather that we might be led to Chriſt Ieſus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and ſo in him find wiſedome, holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, repentance, and godlineſſe of life here in this world, and life euerlaſting, with all glory and happineſſe hereafter in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>To the which end and purpoſe, let vs now in the feare of God, truſting in his grace, and in the bleſſed direction and comfort of his holy Spirit, enter vpon the interpretation of the ſame, the moſt wiſe, holy, and righteous Law of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p>And yet becauſe theſe words Law, ſinne, curſe, repentance, vertue, or righteouſneſſe, and bleſſing will be of often and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vſe in this part of our exerciſe, and therefore alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be well vnderſtood of all: it ſhall be good for vs in few words, to ſet downe the meaning of them before we come to the particular interpretation of the Commandements.</p>
            <p>I aske therefore what this word Law meaneth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lavv of God is a deuine rule or doctrine, vvhich tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and commandeth the perfect righteouſneſſe of vvorkes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is ſo, we may perceiue by that we reade Leuit. 18.5. and Rom. 10.5.</p>
            <p>What is ſinne?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the tranſgreſſion of the Lavv, either in deed, vvord, or thought, neuer ſo litle ſwaruing from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So doth Saint Iohn define ſin, 1. Epiſtle chap. 3. verſ. 4. And Rom. 7.7. Luſt is ſinne. And Marke 7.21. our Sauiour Chriſt telleth vs that wicked thoughts defile a man.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe of the Law, which is the reward of ſinne?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It containeth all the heauy and vvofull effects of Gods wrath, that is to ſay, all the plagues and puniſhments both of ſoule and body in this life, and the euerlaſting torment of hell fire in the vvorld to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is plainly layd forth Leuit. 26. from the 14. verſe, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:182:17"/> Deut. 28. from the 15. verſe,<note place="margin">What ſinne, curſe, bleſſing, &amp;c. do meane.</note> &amp;c. And Chap. 29.18.19 &amp;c. and chap. 32.22.23.24.25. and Iſaiah 30.33. and Matth. 25.41.</p>
            <p>What is repentance, whereby (if it be of faith) the curſe may be auoyded?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is an vtter forſaking of all ſinne, proceeding of hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv for it, vvith vnfeined hatred and ſtrife againſt it: and a zealous following of all true godlineſſe and vertue, vvith conſtant ioy and delight therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the nature of repentance, reade Iſaiah 1.16.17. Amos 5.15. Rom. 12.9. 2. Cor. 7.1.10.11. and Prouerbs chap. 21.15. It is ioy to the iuſt to do iudgement.</p>
            <p>What is vertue or righteouſneſſe, which is the chiefe fruit or part of repentance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is perfect obedience to the Law of God, or any part or point thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true; for the vertues of the heathen ſo called, and of meere ciuil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are not true vertues, not only becauſe the actions thereof proceed not from a mind regenerate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit of God, but alſo becauſe they are done without conſcience of the commandement of God. And therefore the Apoſtle Paule making mention of vertue, Philip. 4.8. he doth in the next verſe, ſhew that the ſame is learned &amp; receiued from the word, and truly exemplified in thoſe onely that haue bene inſtructed and taught from it, and from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God. Reade alſo a liuely deſcription of a right ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman in the laſt chap. of the Prouerbs, in her life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the doctrine of Gods Law. Now what are we to vnderſtand by this word bleſſing, which is the reward of true vertue and obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It comprehendeth euery comfortable fruite and effect of Gods diuine loue &amp; fauour, either for ſoule or body, for this life preſent or to be hoped for in the life to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of this, reade Leuit. 26. from the 3. verſe to the 14. and Deut. 28. from the beginning of the chap. to the 15. verſe. And Matth. 35.34. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let vs go forward: How doth the Law of God, I meane, what courſe doth it take to make knowne our ſinne, and that miſerie which in the iuſtice of God is due to the ſame?</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:182:18"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">After what manner the Law of God detecteth ſinne, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>It doth it firſt by a moſt imperious and ſtrict forbidding of vs euery vvorke, yea, euery word, yea euen euery inward motion &amp; thought of the heart or minde, vvhich is in the very leaſt degree contrarie to it, yea, which is not fully agreeable to the holineſſe &amp; righteouſneſſe vvhich it commandeth: and by a moſt ſeuere and fearfull threatning of the horrible curſe of God, againſt the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the ſame, hovv pleaſant and delightfull ſoeuer ſin is to our vvicked nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the Lavv of God maketh knowne our ſinne, and the vvofull miſerie thereof, by an exact commanding and vrging of perfect obedience to euery Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, both in thought, word, &amp; deed, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary and vnwelcome ſoeuer that be to our owne corrupt vvill &amp; liking. And therewithall by a moſt preciſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning of all deuine fauour and bleſsing, to ſuch only as ſhall perfectly obey the ſame, howſoeuer euery one in the pride of his hart preſumeth, that he is vvorthy aboue other to be bleſſed &amp; happy, hovv negligent ſoeuer he be in the duties therof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Law doth in this wiſe make knowne our ſin and miſerie, we may vnderſtand ſufficiently by that one place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged out of the ſeuenth Chapter to the Romanes, where there is a large diſcourſe to this purpoſe: we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it alſo by calling to mind diuerſe other places, ſuch as we reade in the ſame Epiſtle, Chapter 2.11.12. Deut. 27.15. &amp;c. Gal. 3.10.11.12. Math. 5.19. &amp;c. to the ende of the Chapter, Marke 9.42. &amp;c. to the ende of the Chapter, Heb. 2.2. and Iames 2.10.11. &amp;c. Hence therefore (that is to ſay) from this exact ſeuerity of the Law, ariſeth a maruelous combat and rebellious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction againſt the Law of God, from that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Neuertheleſſe the Law by Gods owne ordinance muſt thus ſeuerely be preached ſtill, according to that firſt authority, wherewith the Lord himſelfe hath once for euer authoriſed &amp; armed it: according to that which we reade Iſaiah. 58.1.

            <p>How many in the ſecond?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The latter ſixe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeed doth the Apoſtle Paule ſhew them to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the 6. cha. to the Eph. verſ. 2. where he reckeneth the fift Commandement for the firſt of the ſecond table: and it is euen of it ſelfe plaine, becauſe of the diſtinct argument &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of either of them. Shew therefore what is the ſumme of the firſt table?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The perfect loue of God, with all duties of his moſt holy and diuine vvorſhip, as fruits and teſtimonies of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the ſumme of the ſecond table?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The perfect loue of our neighbour, and all good fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, toward his honour, life, and perſon, and toward his honeſty, goods, and good name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is ſo, we haue warrant from the anſwer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt to a certaine Phariſey, Math. 22.35. &amp;c. and Marke 12.29.30.31. In the which anſwer our Sauior Chriſt doth both diſtinguiſh the tables as we haue done before, &amp; alſo ſheweth the diſtinct argument and contents of either of them.</p>
            <p>Here notwithſtanding it might be thought we ſhould come forthwith to the particular interpretation of the ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of either table; neuertheleſſe to the ende we may prepare and make the way yet more plaine &amp; eaſie, to a more through vnderſtanding of the Law of God, I would gladly haue you ſhew the fruite of ſo good diligence, as to repeate what you haue bene taught to be yet further generally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the more full &amp; through vnderſtanding of the Law of God, we haue bene taught to obſerue theſe rules following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that it is a ſpirituall Lavv, moſt perfectly vviſe, holy,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:182:19"/> iuſt and equall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Generall rules for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Law of God.</note> 
               <hi>moſt ſtrictly binding the conſciences of all, and euery one of all ſorts and degrees of people, to entire, vvhole and perfect obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that the morall duties of the firſt table vvhich more directly concerne the glory of God, are in their owne nature and kind more excellent then the duties of the ſecond table, vvhich belong to men (they being as the foundation and ſquire, yea, euen the verie life of theſe, as theſe againe are as it vvere the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and triall of the truth of thoſe.) And therefore alſo that the duties of the firſt table are both in zeale of heart, and in diligence of practiſe, to be preferred before the duties of the ſecond, vvhen both ſorts may be performed; or if the caſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo, that either the one or the other muſt of neceſſity be neglected. Prouided notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that there be an equall proportion obſerued, that is, one thought compared vvith another, ſpeech with ſpeech, deed vvith deed, circumſtance vvith circumſtance in the like degree. On the contrary it is to be obſerued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reade</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>and Iſai.</hi> 7.13.</note> 
               <hi>that in the like proportion the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt table is greater &amp; more hainous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And further alſo it is to be obſerued for the making vp of this ſecond rule, that there are diuerſe degrees of good duties commaunded in either table,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>and that there is an inequality of the ſinnes vvhich are forbidden, the one being vnequally and vvith the diſaduantage compared and weighed vvith the other, and accordingly a diuerſe degree or meaſure of the curſe &amp; puniſhments, either in this life or in the vvorld to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, to the more thorough vnderstanding of the Lavv of God, vve are to obſerue, that vvhat euill or ſinne ſoeuer is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in any Commandement, there the contrary good thing or vertue is commanded: and on the other ſide, vvhat good thing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is commanded, there the contrary euill thing is forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that vnder one thing expreſſely either commanded or forbidden, all of the ſame kind, &amp; vvhat ſoeuer cauſeth or any vvay helpeth and furthereth the ſame, they are likewiſe either commanded or forbidden as coadiutors and acceſſaries therunto, or as hauing a mutuall relation the one to the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, that albeit for order of doctrine there is a moſt perfect diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, yet as touching practiſe, they are ſo nearly knit together, that no one can be perfectly obeied,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:182:19"/> vnleſſe all be obeyed, &amp; one being tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſed al are tranſgreſſed. And for the ſame cauſe alſo there are ſome kind of duties, &amp; the contrary tranſgreſſions either commanded or forbidden in many: yea, ſundry times in all the Commandements, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe or contrary ends &amp; purpoſes vvhereunto they do ſerue, &amp; according as they are either diuerſly or contrarily applied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly, that the curſe of eternall death and of all the euils &amp; miſeries of this life, is due to the leaſt tranſgreſſion of any part or branch of the Law, and much rather the generall tranſgreſsion and contempt of it; but that the bleſsing of euerlaſting life is not due as a deſerued reward or det, vnleſſe the whole Lavv be fully and perfectly obeyed, as vvas anſwered before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seuenthly, that our Sauior Chriſt only of all men hath perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled &amp; obeyed the Law; but that all other are tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and therefore iuſtly vnder the curſe and condemnation vvhich it awardeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that vvithout faith in the ſame our Sauiour Christ, none can be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curſe threatned by the Law, much leſſe partaker of any bleſsing promiſed in any of the Commandements, and least of all a partaker of euerlaſting happineſſe. And yet tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe that do truly beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, and earneſtly repent of all their ſinnes, that their ſincere though vnperfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is accepted vvith God, and ſhall of his free and vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued grace on our parts only, for Chriſts ſake be perfectly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, partly here in this world, but fully after this life in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, according to the diuerſe degrees and meaſure of euery mans faith and obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe things are neceſſarie to be obſerued indeed: the proofes whereof are for the moſt part cleare in themſelues; the which yet I will briefly repeate, that ye may the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and that they may be more firmely fixed in your minds.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe God is a Spirit, moſt wiſe, holy, and righteous, therefore muſt his Law be anſwerable to himſelfe, &amp;c. Reade Deut. 4.5. &amp;c. Pſal. 19.7. &amp;c. Rom. 7.12.14.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, third, and fourth, may eaſily be confirmed by conſidering them in their inſtances: for the exemplifying of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the prouing of them. And touching the diuerſe degrees of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:182:20"/> curſe or puniſhment,<note place="margin">Particular rules for the interpretation of euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> reade Math. 11.20. &amp;c. &amp; chap. 12.45. &amp; Luk. 10.12. and chap. 12.47. Rom. 1.27. &amp;c. and chap. 2.1. &amp;c. 2. Theſ 2.11.12. and 2. Tim. 4.14. &amp;c. and 2. Peter 2.20.21. Numb. 15.26. &amp;c. compared with verſes 30. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the fift and ſixt, reade againe Deut. 27. the laſt verſe, and Gal. 3.10. Rom. 3.19.20. and Iames 2.10.11. For the proofe of the ſeuenth, reade Rom. 8.3.4. and chap. 10.3. and 2. Cor. 5.21. 1. Pet. 2.22. &amp; 3.18. and 1. Iohn 3.5. Iſaiah 53.5. &amp;c. And Ier. 23.6. The Lord our righteouſnes. And the places before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Rom. 3.21.22. and Gal. 3.12.13.14. and verſes 21.22.</p>
            <p>For the laſt point, reade alſo Rom. 8.1. &amp;c. 1. Tim. 1.9. Acts 10.34.35. Pſal. 19.11. &amp; 91.14.15.16. Mat. 10.42. and chap. 25.34. &amp;c. 2. Cor. 5.10. 2. Tim. 4.8. Math. 5.12. Hebr. 11.6. Gal. 6.7. and 2. Cor. 9.6.</p>
            <p>And now theſe things obſerued more generally, we may perceiue the more eaſily what is to be conſidered in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular handling of euery commandement, the which things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo haue bene declared. I would gladly heare them likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed of you, they being well neare the ſame with the other. Shew therefore which they be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe vvhich follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the ſence and meaning of the Commandement, &amp; that alſo first negatiuely vvhat is forbidden, and then affirmatiuely vvhat is commanded, in the</hi> 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. <hi>But in the</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 5. <hi>commandements, firſt affirmatiuely vvhat is commanded, and after negatiuely vvhat is forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the particular equity of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the particular bleſsing promiſed to the perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, the particular curſes or puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts threatned againſt al ſuch as either make ſhew of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only in hypocriſy &amp; diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or do neuer ſo litle tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe againſt any duty required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, the particular application of the curſes due to euery one, in reſpect of the ſame particular mutterings and ſecret rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, as they are in any, more or leſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, a particular declaration, how our Sauior Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath perfectly obeyed the Commandement which we haue in hand, and what manner of obedience to the ſame, that is, vvhich
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:182:20"/> God accepteth at the hands of the faithfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reaſon for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing of Gods Law.</note> 
               <hi>for Chriſt Ieſus his ſake, though it be vveake and vnperfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thus obſerued: let vs come to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: which is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus. Thou ſhalt haue, or let there be no ſtrange God to thee before my face, for ſuch are the words of the originall text, though in the ſame ſence and meaning, with our vſuall and accuſtomed tranſlation. But in the 20. Chapter of Exodus where the Law of God is ſet downe, there are other words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe (which as ye may remember) haue bene interpreted vnto you: Which are thoſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpake al theſe words, ſaying: I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egipt, out of the houſe of bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the holy la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage we reade, out of the houſe of ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but in the ſame ſence, becauſe the Iſraelites were there in ſeruitude and bondage, read Leu. 26.13. Deut. 4.20. and 1. King. 8.51. and Deu. 5.15. But what were you taught to obſerue in the words of Moſes writing thus: Then God ſpake all theſe words?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſide that the diuine authority and perfection of the whole Law, &amp; of euery part and branch thereof is thence to be noted, in ſo much as all was publiſhed and pronounced from heauen by the Lord himſelfe, vve vvere further taught to marke the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, in two reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that God giueth his Law to his people ſhortly after he had deliuered them out of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that before he publiſhed and pronounced the ſame, he did both ſolemnly prepare &amp; aſſemble them together to heare it, and alſo ſet before their eyes diuerſe fearfull and glorious ſignes of his diuine preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why did the Lord publiſh his Law ſo ſhortly after he had deliuered his people out of bondage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To let them vnderſtand that the end of their deliuerance was, not that they ſhould follow their owne wicked luſts, but to ſerue him in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe all the dayes of their liues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the very true end of all Gods mercifull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances &amp; bleſſings; &amp; this vſe ſtand we bound to make of them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:182:21"/> all,<note place="margin">The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Law of God.</note> but chiefly of thoſe that are the greateſt, as it is expreſly noted in the Goſpell concerning the end of our redemption by Chriſt, whereof this deliuerance of Iſrael out of Egypt was to them a figure and pledge.</p>
            <p>And that the ende of this their deliuerance was, that they might the more freely ſerue God; reade Exod. 4.22.23. and chap. 5.1. and chap. 7.16. and chap. 8.1.20. and chap. 9.1.13. &amp; chap. 10.3. Reade alſo Deut. 5.15.</p>
            <p>But why did the Lord ſo ſolemnly prepare and aſſemble his people together, before he did publiſh his Law vnto them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they might vvith one mind, as members of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politike or common vvealth, reuerently heare it, vvith full purpoſe of heart to obey it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt meet that it ſhould ſo be heard, not only of them, but of vs alſo, if we mind to reape any good fruite and bene- by it. For if we heare it not with a purpoſe and endeuour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, we ſhall neuer haue experience of our owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor of the power of Gods grace, nor of the benefite of a ſauiour, for the which cauſe it is that he ſpeaketh ioyntly vnto all, as if he ſhould ſpeake apart to euery one.</p>
            <p>And why did he ſhew foorth ſo fearfull ſignes of his diuine preſence at the publiſhing of his Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To awaken their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences to the ſight of their former ſins, &amp; of their preſent frailty and corruption, &amp; that his feare might be in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a bridle to hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe from ſin, for the time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This courſe was indeed moſt fit to procure and worke thoſe effects and vſes for the which the Law ſerueth, euen according to that which was anſwered before, read Exod. 20 20 where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more when we come to theſe words of Moſes.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, let vs come to the words of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he vttered by his owne moſt glorious voyce from heauen: ſaying, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage: How haue you learned to vnderſtand theſe words?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They may be vnderſtood both as a particular reaſon and ground of the firſt Commandement, and alſo as a general reaſon and ground in vvay of a preface to the vvhole Lavv.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:182:21"/>
            <p>Why is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe they containe ſuch a deſcription of this heauenly Law-giuer, as ſheweth that he hath moſt ſoueraigne right to command all, and that he alone is moſt worthie aboue all to be in all things obeyed aboue all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade Leuit. chap. 19. verſ. 3.4. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which are the parts of this deſcription?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt it ſheweth vvhat manner of one our heauenly Law-giuer is in his owne diuine nature and being: &amp; ſecondly what his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good will and pleaſure is toward his people, vpon condition they vvill ſubmit themſelues to be obedient vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words of the deſcription doth he ſhew, what his diuine nature and being is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that he proclaimeth himſelfe to be the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What meaneth this word Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he onely is eternall, of moſt high and excellent Maieſty, vvithout beginning and without end, the cauſe of the being of all things, in ſo much as he hath created them of nothing, and much rather the cauſe why anie creature ſhall haue any euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting continuance and abiding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the naturall interpretation and meaning of the word Iehoua, for the which we vſe to ſay Lord, following herein the Greeke tranſlation of the Bible, after the example of the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles in the New Teſtament. Not that we thinke it vnlawfull to ſpeake the name Iehoua, as ſome of the Iewes haue ſuperſtitiouſly imagined, but becauſe vſe hath thus preuailed. Onely it is neceſſarie that we vnderſtand this title Lord, in the ſignification of Iehoua. For the which reade E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xodus 3.14. and chapter 6.3. and Pſalme 90.1.2.3.4. Now what is the meaning of the other word, God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the ſame Lord, who is the onely eternall, and the cauſe of the being of all things, is alſo all-ſufficient and almightie, both to ſupport and maintaine all things vvhich he hath created, and alſo to rule, gouerne, and order them all, according to the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good pleaſure of his diuine prouidence and will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the ſignification of the title Elohim, noting the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold vertue and power of the Godhead, yea and euen the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons of the Godhead alſo in the moſt perfect vnitie of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:182:22"/> the diuine nature. Of the which more is to be ſaid vpon the Articles of our beliefe: Now, what is the gracious good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and will of God toward his people: in which words of the deſcription is it expreſſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt in the vvord, Thy, in that he ſaith, I am the Lord thy God, vvhich is a vvord of couenant and promiſe: &amp; then in thoſe vvhich follovv, vvhich are a confirmation, and as it vvere a pavvne and pledge of the couenant, in that he did moſt mightily, &amp; moſt mercifully deliuer his people out of the bondage of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The condition of the couenant of the Law being ſuch, as no man can performe it, (ſeeing it promiſeth not life to anie, vnles it be fulfilled) how ſhould it containe anie declaration and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Gods loue to his people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is of Gods gracious goodneſſe and mercie, that he promiſeth life vpon that condition, in ſo much as therein he requireth no more then he had created and fitted mankind vnto in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the creation: but the ſpeciall declaration and confirmation of Gods loue in this his couenant, conſiſteth in that it hath a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Chriſt, by whome it is fulfilled for vs aſwell as for the Ievves, and for vvhoſe ſake God is minded to forgiue the ſinnes of all that ſhall truely beleeue in him, &amp; alſo to vvrite his Lavv in their hearts by his holy Spirit, euen to the end of the vvorld.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for notwithſtanding this couenant thus reſpecting Chriſt, was firſt entred with the Iſraelites, yet it is now exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs, God profeſſing himſelfe to be not onely the God of the Iewes, but alſo of the Gentiles. Rom. 3.29.30.31. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former propheſies of the calling of the gentils, Read Pſalme 87. and Hoſ. chap. 1.10. and 2.23. and Ioel 2.32. Amos 19.11.12. Mal. 1.11. Neither was Iſrael ſo the onely people of God at anie time, but that alwaies it pleaſed him to aceept of the Gentils, ſuch as would ioyne them ſelues to his people in the true worſhip of him. And although we for our parts haue not bene deliuered out of the bondage of Egypt, yet the Lord hath deliuered vs with a more gracious deliuerance out of the bondage of ſin and the Diuell, and from the tyrannie of death, and from the torment of hell, whereof alſo that deliuerance of theirs was a figure and pledge vnto them. Let vs now come to the firſt Commandement.</p>

               <hi>To haue anie ſtrange God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is this to haue anie ſtrange God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To haue a ſtrange God, is either to acknovvledge vvith the heart, or to fancie and conceiue in the mind, any other to be God, either beſide (as altogether excluding the onely true God) or ioyntly, yea or if it be in any inferiour degree together vvith him, vvho hath made himſelfe ſo euidently knovvne by his vvord and vvorkes, as that vvhich he hath manifested of himſelfe, cannot poſſibly agree to anie other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then eſpecially is a ſtrange God taken and acknovvledged for God, vvhen anie ſpirituall and diuine worſhip is yeelded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; that is to ſay, vvhen any faith and truſt, any feare, loue, prayer, prayſe, thankes, or any other like dutie is yeelded vpon the ſame falſe conceit and acknovvledgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is principally that which the Lord forbiddeth in this Commandement: according to that which we reade in the 8. and 9. verſes of the 81. Pſalme.</p>
            <p>As touching the reſt of the tranſgreſſions of it (which are verie manie) we ſhall haue a fit occaſion to note them, and that alſo by a more plaine and eaſie direction, after we haue ſeene what be the good duties or ſpirituall graces commaunded in the ſame. In the meane ſeaſon, let vs well obſerue concerning the preſent anſwere: that the Lord doth not onely forbid his people the vtter excluding of him, that they might altogether imbrace falſe Gods, but alſo the ioyning of anie with him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as copartner, or though it be but in an inferiour degree of minoritie as it were: for ſo doth the Lord interpret his owne meaning in the 23. verſe of this 20. chapter of Exodus, and Deuteronomy 32. verſe 39. Reade alſo 1. Kings 18.21. and 2. Kings 17.33. and Iohn 4.22. Reade alſo Iudges, chapter 2.11. &amp;c. to the end, and chapter 3.7. and Pſalme 81.11. and Pſalme 106.37.</p>
            <p>All the Gods of the heathen are meere vanitie: Leuiticus, chapter 19 4. Deuteronomie, 32.21. and 1. Samuel 12.21. and 1. Kinges 16.13.26. and 1. Corinthians 8.4.5.6. whence the houſe of the ſtrange God is called Bethanuen, the houſe of vanitie, Hoſh. 4.15.</p>

Reade alſo Iud. chapter 6. verſe 8.9.10. and 1. Kings 17.35.36. and Pſalme 115. and Exodus, 23.13. and Pſalme 16. No truſt, no loue, no prayer, no prayſe, &amp;c. belongeth to them, The Lord will not giue his glorie to anie other. Iſai. 44.6.7.8. No god beſide the Lord, chapter 45. foure times repeated in that one chapter, and chapter 48.11. Surely, I wil not giue my glorie to another, ſaith the Lord. Wherfore right worthie is that excellent profeſſion of the Prophet to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all the ſeruants of God, Pſalme 73.25. where he ſaith vnto God: Whome haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired none in the earth with thee.</p>
            <p>Finally let vs diligently note, that the Lord forbiddeth theſe ſinnes, and all of this kind, as being before his face, he giuing therin to vnderſtand, that none of theſe ſinnes can be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they are knowne to him, and that he taketh them as done to his exceeding great diſhonour, &amp;c. Reade Pſalme 44. verſ. 20.21.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, let vs ſee what good ſpiritual duties the Lord requireth and commandeth in this firſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: What haue ye learned to be the wil of God herein?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we do both rightly knovv and diſcerne, euen in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of our mind, and alſo that vve do ioyfully acknovvledge with our whole ſoule, that God to be our onely Lord, eternall and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, moſt vviſe, moſt holy, moſt righteous, most gracious, &amp; mercifull, moſt faithfull and true, euen the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, the Creatour, gouernour, and preſeruer of all things, the Supreme and Soueraigne iudge of all the vvorld, one God to be bleſſed for euer, vvho hath manifeſtly reuealed himſelf first to his people Iſrael in ſpeciall manner aboue anie other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and novv more clearely to all beleeuing Gentils through the vvhole vvorld, both by his diuine vvord, and alſo by his moſt gracious and vvonderfull vvorkes: and that vve do acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame his workes, and all other from the greateſt to the leaſt of them, to be done and ordered in all perfection of vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe, faithfulneſſe and truth, in most
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:182:23"/> excellent manner aboue all that vve can conceiue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God requireth alſo in this firſt commandement, that as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie fruite of this true knovvledge and heartie acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him, and of the moſt perfect vviſedome and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of all his vvorkes, vve do vviſely, entirely, zealouſly and conſtantly yeeld him alone as moſt vvorthie, all true, diuine, and ſpirituall ſeruice and vvorſhip, and no part therof to anie other, as hath bene anſvvered before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This verily is the end, wherefore the Lord hath manifeſted and reuealed himſelfe, namely, that he might be knowne and acknowledged of his people. Reade Deut. 4.32. &amp;c. to the 40. verſe, and Iſaiah. 43.10.11.12.</p>
            <p>This alſo was neceſſarie. For elſe how ſhould he be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhipped and ſerued here in this world? According to thy name, ſo is thy prayſe vnto the worlds end (that is, ouer all the earth) thy right hand is full of righteouſneſſe: Pſ. 48.10. And that this our God is moſt worthie of all diuine worſhip and ſeruice, his verie nature which is moſt excellent ſheweth it. Reade alſo 1. Chronicles 29.10. &amp;c. And Nehem. 9.5. Pſal. 89.6.7.8. &amp;c. and Micah. 7.18. &amp;c. and Deut. 32.31. Their God is not as our God, euen our enemies being iudges.</p>
            <p>Worthie therefore in this place is the admonition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremie, which he giueth in the name of the Lord, chap. 9.23.24. Let not the wiſe man glorie in his wiſedome, &amp;c. but in this, that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To conclude the proofe of this anſwere, that God is to be acknowledged wholly and in all his eſſentiall &amp; diuine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, moſt wiſe, moſt iuſt, &amp;c. Reade Exod. 34.6.7. and Deut. 32.3.4. Now I would know of you wherein the ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice of this onely true God, the eternall and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie Lord of heauen and earth doth ſtand?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It standeth in the holy meditation of God, his vvord &amp; works, both of Creation and gouernement, ſpecially concerning his Church: it standeth in faith, or truſt, &amp; belief, in hope, in loue, in zeale, in feare, or reuerence, in humbleneſſe and ſobrietie of mind, rightly to vſe all good gifts and bleſſings of God, in patience and meekeneſſe of ſpirit to endure all vvants and afflictions, hovvſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it ſhall pleaſe God to exerciſe and try our faith; it standeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:182:24"/> in prayer ioyned vvith thankeſgiuing in all things: finally, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the dedicating of our ſelues, ſoules and bodies, and al that vve haue, and vvhatſoeuer God ſhall bleſſe vs vvithall, to the honour and prayſe of his name, and that in a moſt ſacred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret couenant, oath, and vowe betwixt him alone and our owne conſciences, in ſtead of a thouſand vvitneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may not vnfitly call to mind, that the beginning of our Catechiſme is confirmed by the Lord himſelfe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his moſt wiſe, holy, and righteous Law; he ſetting that in the firſt place, which is principally moſt worthie, and moſt neceſſarie aboue all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame cauſe, this commandement is moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be conſidered and weighed of vs, becauſe it is as the foundation, light, and life of al the reſt of the commandements, not onely of the ſecond Table, but alſo euen of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore, I pray you in the name of God, without all preiudiciall conceit of vnneceſſarie tediouſneſſe, continue ſtill in a further inquirie &amp; more large ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>

I haue ſworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgements. and Pſal. 76.11. Reade alſo Prouerbes 3.9. A ſolemne profeſſion of this among the Iſraelites, was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of their firſt borne, and of their firſt fruites vnto God.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſpirituall graces and duties of Gods diuine ſeruice and worſhip, concerning the which, we haue in this place two things to call to mind, worthie our further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they are all of them deriued from the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acknowledgement of God, in ſuch maner as he hath deſcribed himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, which are the manifold ſinnes, whereby this holy Law of God is broken both on the right hand and on the left, both in exceſſe after a ſort in paſſing the bounds of due mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and alſo in the defect and failing, or comming too ſhort in the performance of good dutie. Whether we call them ſins directly contrarie, or in a certaine diſparagement, diſagreeing to true vertue, and one of them to another. For this point was promiſed to be opened more particularly in this place.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:182:26"/>
            <p>Touching the firſt of theſe points therefore we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the ſoule of man cannot truely know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be eternall and almightie, moſt wiſe, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, iuſt, faithfull, and true, but it muſt needes (through the grace of God) be drawne and encouraged, to place faith, truſt, and hope in him, as Pſalme 9.10. They that know thy name will truſt in thee: and Pſalme 62.8.11.12.</p>
            <p>How loue ariſeth from the experience of Gods power and mercie in deliuerance &amp; defence, reade Pſ. 18.1. &amp;c. &amp; Pſ. 116. &amp;c. and Pſ. 5.11. loue is reckened for a companion with truſt.</p>
            <p>For feare, read Mat. 10.28. Feare him, who is able to deſtroy both bodie and ſoule in hell. Read alſo Ier. 10.6.7. and 5.22. &amp; Reu. 15.3.4. and 1. Sam. 12.24. Read alſo Eccleſ. 12. v. 13.14.</p>
            <p>For humilitie, reade 1. Peter. 5.6. Humble your ſelues vnder the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. For patience, read Iob 1.21. the Lord hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Read alſo Ierem. 14.22.</p>
            <p>How prayer groweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercie &amp; power, reade Deut. 4.29.30.31. &amp;c. and Pſ. 32.5.6. &amp; Pſ. 65.2.</p>
            <p>For praiſe and thanks with vowing our ſelues to God, reade Pſalme 75.1. and Pſal. 76.1.11. and Pſal. 56.9. &amp;c. to the end.</p>
            <p>Who duely conſidering, that God is infinitely wiſe, will not ſubmit himſelfe to be taught wiſedome of him, and to be ordered in all things by him? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus we may perceiue as it were by a ſample and taſt, how all ſpirituall graces and duties of Gods worſhip, do ſpring from the true knowledge and acknowledgement of God, in ſuch manner as he hath deſcribed his owne moſt excellent maieſtie in his word, and made himſelfe knowne by his moſt wonderfull and glorious workes.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the ſecond point, that is, which are the ſins both on the right hand and on the left, we may by a more eaſie and plaine direction (as was ſayd before) well conſider of them in the order of theſe graces now rehearſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, againſt the knowledge and acknowledgement of God on the left hand and in the defect, is ignorance of God, or no acknowledgement; alſo erronious opinions of his nature, or will, or workes; contempt of his true knowledge, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:182:26"/> of falſe Gods, &amp;c. and on the other hand,<note place="margin">Sins forbidden</note> curious ſearching into the ſecrets of God.</p>
            <p>Againſt faith, on the one hand is incredulitie, doubting, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, &amp;c. and on the other hand, carnall ſecuritie, and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, without warrant of Gods word.</p>
            <p>Againſt hope, in the defect, no hope, no reioycing in hope, vtter diſpaire: in exceſſe, hope without true faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againſt loue, either no loue, or ſelf-loue, &amp; loue of the creature more then of the Creator, &amp;c. or ſuperſtitious loue in a blind zeale. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againſt true zele, in defect, lukewarmnes, &amp;c. in exceſſe, zele without knowledge &amp; diſcretion, ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous.</p>
            <p>Againſt the true feare and reuerence of God, in defect, no feare of God, no boldneſſe or courage in the way of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, feare of creatures more then of God, or as much as of God: ſpecially the feare of the Diuel and his chiefe inſtruments of miſchiefe, as though God were not able to defend: In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſeruile feare or terrour, as if God were a tyrant, and no mercie to be found with him: ſuperſtitious feare in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as there is no iuſt cauſe to feare.</p>
            <p>Againſt humbleneſſe of mind in defect, pride, which hath manie euill properties: in exceſſe, counterfeit modeſtie.</p>
            <p>Againſt ſobrietie of mind touching the right vſe of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: wantonneſſe againſt God, contempt of God, delight in the creature more then in God the giuer: in which reſpect, manie are ſaid to make their belly their God, &amp;c. and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſpirituall fornication with the creatures.</p>
            <p>Againſt patience or meekeneſſe of ſpirit in defect, and as it were on the left hand, impatience, frowardneſſe, curſing and blaſpheming: in exceſſe, Stoicall ſottiſhneſſe, Popiſh &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie whipping of men, their owne ſelues.</p>
            <p>Againſt prayer in defect, no prayer to God, cold &amp; ſeldome prayer, prayer without knowledge, faith, repentance, &amp;c. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, much babling, prayer of ſuperſtitious &amp; blind deuotion, prayers to Saints or Angels, ioyned with the inuocation of the name of God.</p>
            <p>Againſt thankfulnes to God: in defect, no thanks, ſeldome thankes, cold thankes from the teeth outward, as we ſay,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:182:27"/> leſſening of benefits, thankefulneſſe to the inſtruments of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more then to God himſelfe the fountaine of them, thanks for earthly bleſsings more then for ſpirituall and heauenly giftes or graces. In exceſſe, religious thankefulneſſe to falſe Gods, thankes to the true God for ſucceſſe in all matters, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againſt ſpirituall dedicating, vowing, or ſwearing, our ſouls and bodies, and all that we haue, to the honour and ſeruice of God; in defect, is no vowing or regard of that militarie oth and ſouldier-fare, which we haue taken at our Baptiſme, &amp;c. In exceſſe, the wicked vowing or ſwearing of anie, to aſſociate themſelues with the maintainers of Idolatrous religion, and the falſe and ſuperſtitious worſhip thereof: as Papiſtes in the Councell of Trent, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here alſo may it not be amiſſe, to note that which ſhould haue beene remembred before, as a ſinne on the left hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to faith or truſt in God: that is to ſay, concerning coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, which of the Apoſtle Paul is called Idolatrie, that is, the worſhipping of an Idol or falſe God, in ſtead of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God, in ſo much as the heart of a couetous man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the deſire and hope of that which he coueteth. Oh thinketh he, if I could once get thus much monie before hand; if I could purchaſe ſuch a purchaſe; If I could make my twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pounds fortie, or my hundreth pounds two hundreth, or as another longeth to make his fiue hundreth, a thouſand, &amp;c. then I ſhould thinke my ſelfe happie, I ſhould be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the world, &amp;c. Alas ſay they, what is a man without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? Theſe and the like are ſpeeches, thoughts and meditations of diſtruſt in God, and truſt in riches, whereby we deny God, Iob chapter 31.24. and 28.</p>
            <p>And wherewith we commit a ſpirituall Idolatrie, and a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall adulterie with riches, Reade Iames chapter 4.4. and 1. Timothie 5.11.12. Reade alſo Iohn 1. Epiſtle 3.15.16.17.</p>
            <p>Let vs now proceede to the other things which are remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: What is the particular equitie of this commaundement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing the knowledge and acknowledgement of God, is the moſt excellent and profitable knowledge of all other, as that wherein ſtandeth eternall life, we ought to take ſpeciall delight in it.</hi>

            <p>

               <hi>faithfully to performe what ſoeuer he hath promiſed, and hath alſo confirmed the ſame by his diuine oth, vve may boldly put our trust in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing he is moſt louing and kind to vs firſt, yea though we are by naturall corruption his enemies, and moſt vnworthie of his loue, it is moſt meete that we ſhould the rather loue him againe vvith like loue, that is, vvith a most pure, earneſt and conſtant loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing he is moſt righteous, iudging without reſpect of perſons, it is good reaſon we ſhould reuerence and feare him aboue all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing he is moſt wiſe, &amp; knoweth better then our ſelues, what is beſt for vs, vve ought patiently and meekely to ſubmit our ſelues to his corrections, &amp; to the whole courſe of his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi>

               <hi>Seeing he hath promiſed to heare vs, it is good reaſon we ſhold make our prayers to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing we receiue all things from his bountifull hands, it is our bounden dutie to be thankefull to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, ſeeing we haue our being and whole maintenance in and from the Lord, according as it is ſaid: In him vve liue and moue, and haue our being: and ſeeing he hath both couenanted, and promiſed, &amp; ſworne himſelfe to be our God for euer: it muſt needes be acknowledged to stand with all reaſon and moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dutie, that we ſhould for our parts couenant, vow and ſweare perpetuall allegiance and obedience vnto him.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>And firſt, what is the particular bleſsing of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God?</p>

               <hi>Becauſe he hath loued me (ſaith the Lord) therefore I will deliuer him, I will exalt him, becauſe he hath knowne my name.

               <hi>If thou vvilt not feare this glorious and fearefull name, the Lord thy God: then (ſayth Moſes) the Lord will make thy plagues vvonderfull, and the plagues of thy ſeed, euen great plagues and of long continuance, and ſore diſeaſes, and of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Deuteronomie</hi> 28.58.59.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>If any loue not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him be had in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: yea, excommunicated to death,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22.</p>
            <p>The chiefe reaſon of this is, becauſe Chriſt is God to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for euer, and becauſe God hath loued vs only in him &amp; for his ſake. Neither would the Apoſtle haue written thus, if he had not knowne that ſuch are accurſed before God.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe of luke-warmeneſſe, and want of zeale towards the glory of God?</p>
            <p>

            <p>What is the curſe of pride?</p>

               <hi>The Lord reſiſteth the proud, and whoſoeuer exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall be brought low, Luke</hi> 18.14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.6.</p>

            <p>What is the curſe againſt impatience, murmuring and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord vvill come to giue iudgement againſt murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and complainers, as we reade in the Epiſtle of Iude, verſes.</hi> 15.16.</p>

            <p>What is the curſe againſt vnthankfulneſſe to God for his benefites and bleſſings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe when the Gentiles knevv God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull, &amp;c. God gaue them vp to their harts lusts, Rom.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee in ſome part the particular bleſſings of this Commaundement vppon the obedience of it, and on the contrarie, the particular curſes againſt the tranſgreſſions. Now therefore, that we may come to the vſe of it: Haue you perfectly obeyed this Law, that you may from hence chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the bleſſings promiſed, and eſcape the curſes threatned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, but contrariwiſe I must needes confeſſe that I haue grieuouſly broken it, and that I do ſtill daily breake it. For euen from my youth, there is in my ſinfull nature a contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, vvhereby I am held captiue in ignorance and profaneneſſe, in infidelitie and ſelfe loue, in loue of idle, vaine and vvanton paſtimes and delights, more then in the loue of God and of the holy inſtructions of his vvord: I am negligent in prayer, full of fretting and impatience, and of vnthankefulneſſe to God: yea, infinite are my ſinnes and failings againſt the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this holy Commaundement aboue that I am able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This verily is the naturall diſpoſition and eſtate of vs all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the wombe, as may appeare not onely by particular teſtimonies of the holy Scriprures, but alſo by many reaſons drawne from the ſame, and from common experience alſo: ſo that when it is truly ſayd in reſpect of all the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, we may wel vnderſtand it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chiefly in regard of this: Who knoweth the errours of this life? clenſe me from ſecret faults. Keepe thy ſeruant alſo from preſumptuous ſinnes, let them not reigne ouer me, &amp;c. Pſal. 19.12.13. And Ier. 17.9. Yea beſides our errors, infinite are our naturall rebellions, &amp; the ſuggeſtions of the diuell, to hinder the obedience of this Commandement. If we be preſſed very hard with conſcience of our duty, we are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:182:30"/> readie without the grace of God, to caſt of the yoake,<note place="margin">Perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for vs.</note> and to ſay, who is the Lord? To walke by faith, is in our iudgment follie, and the next way to beggery. The feare of God bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth melancholy. And may we not loue God &amp; the world too? what neede we pray? God knoweth what we need before we aske: and Gods will ſhall take place whether we pray or no. But who can recken al the replyings and mutterings of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and prophane hearts this way?</p>
            <p>Seeing then neither your ſelfe nor any other of vs haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and kept this Law, neither do nor can keepe it as we ought, it followeth that you together with vs all haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the curſes threatned in it.</p>
            <p>Haue you not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I muſt needs acknowledge that I haue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all muſt needs acknowledge it, not mutually among our ſelues one to another, but chiefly to God, with godly ſorrow and lamentation in our ſoules for the ſame, if happily we will not deceiue our ſelues.</p>
            <p>But is there no meanes to auoyd the curſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes: by faith in Ieſus Christ, vvho hath perfectly fulfilled it for vs, and giuen himſelfe to the death for our ſinnes, vve ſhall not onely eſcape euery curſe, but alſo be partaker of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe indeed was Chriſt made accurſed for vs, that we might be made the heires of bleſſing through him, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians 3.13.14.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore our deliuerance and comfort ſtandeth in the obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt, me thinke it ſhould be to good purpoſe for vs to conſider of ſome teſtimonies of holy Scriptures, which ſhew that he hath obeyed this Law for vs.</p>
            <p>What proofe can you alledge for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 11. <hi>chapter of Iſaiah, from the beginning of the chapter to the</hi> 6. <hi>verſe, vve haue one very ſpeciall proofe.</hi>

            <p>But are you now diſcharged from obedience to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, becauſe Chriſt hath obeyed it for you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am onely diſcharged of the guiltineſſe of my ſinne, and of the curſe due to the ſame: but as touching obedience, I ſtand bound for my redemption ſake, to knovv and acknowledge the Lord to be my God and Sauiour in Chriſt, and therefore alſo that I do more ſtedfaſtly beleeue in him, more heartily loue him, more dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue him, and finally, that I be euery vvay more aboundantly thankefull and obedient vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, and ſtandeth with al good reaſon. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vpon ſo iuſt an occaſion, let vs diligently obſerue, that howſoeuer there is an infinite difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpell in reſpect of vs, and as they are for the ſame cauſe oppoſed the one to the other, ſpecially in the point of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſaluation (the ſame Law being the miniſtery of the curſe of death and damnation, through the diſcouery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of our ſinne, as hath bene ſhewed before: the Goſpell on the other ſide being the miniſtery of grace and bleſſing, of life and ſaluation) yet in Chriſt Ieſus the Law and the Goſpell are reconciled, and the righteouſneſſe of the one is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the other, and the duties of this are the duties of that, and the bleſſing of either is in ſubſtance and effect one and the ſame bleſſing. But yet ſeeing you cannot attaine to the perfect obedience of it; to what purpoſe is it that you ſhould take any great care or indeuour with any great labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the obedience of it?</p>

               <hi>God in Chriſt Ieſus, and for his ſake, forgiuing my ſinnes, and renewing me vnto himſelfe by his holy Spirit, hath of his moſt free and bounteous grace promiſed to accept of my vveake faith and vnperfect obedience, yea, and to bleſſe me for it more and more, ſo long as I acknowledging him, louing, fearing, and

            <p>Now bleſſed be the Lord our God, who hath thus prepared vs ſo bleſſed a remedy, and for that he hath giuen vs his holy Spirit, and for that he hath made vs partakers of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſo vnſpeakable conſolation and comfort in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp;c.

            <p>Is there nothing contayned in all theſe words but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is beſide the Commandement a reaſon annexed to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye ſay well: the Commandement is this: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image, &amp;c. The reaſon followeth: for I the Lord thy God am a iealous God, &amp;c.

            <p>Why is that?</p>

            <p>Now firſt of all, what doth the Lord forbid in this ſecond Commandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all, in this ſecond Commandement the Lord forbiddeth not only the making, dedicating, or conſecrating and ſetting vp of any kind of Image and likneſſe of any creature, thereby to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our ſelues, either his diuine Maieſty, or anie ſtrange God, but alſo he forbiddeth that we ſhould once fancy or contayne in our minds any bodily likeneſſe or ſhape of the diuine nature.</hi>

            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:182:32"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, he forbiddeth vs to bovv downe the body, or to yeeld any other externall ſeruice and vvorſhip, to the honour either of the Image ſo fancied, made, dedicated and ſet vp, or of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or any ſtrange God in or by the Image, either in priuate cloſet, oratory, or Chappell, or in any publike high vvay, market place, Church or Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, he forbiddeth all wil-worſhip, that is to ſay, euery forme and practiſe of diuine worſhip and ſeruice, either in the whole or in any part, and all the ſuperſtitious rights and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof, though it be without idols and images, beſides that outward forme only, with thoſe holy rights and ceremonies which he himſelfe hath for the time being, commanded to be vſed and practiſed according to the preſcript rule of his word; either here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore vnder the Law among the Iewes, or now euer ſince vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell, among all Chriſtian nations to the ende of the vvorld.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, the Lord forbiddeth vs to rest in any or all the outward duties of that worſhip vvhich he himſelfe hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as though he vvere pleaſed with the vvorke vvrought (as they ſay) vnleſſe they be done in faith and repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, he forbiddeth all true worſhippers of him, to enterpriſe any neare ſocietie and familiarity vvith idolaters, either by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or by bodily preſence at their idoll ſeruice, or any of their idolatrous and feſtiuall aſſemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, he forbiddeth all deſire and lingering affection of hart towards idolatry or any other falſe, erronious &amp; hereticall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of religious vvorſhip.</hi>

            <p>For the ſecond the expreſſe words of the Commandement are cleare. The true worſhippers of God bow not the knee to Baal. 1. Kings 19.18. Of more ſecret and priuate, or houſhold idolatrie, reade Iudges chap. 17. and Gen. 31.19.30.32.34. and chapter 35.1.2.3.4. Deut. 27.15.</p>
            <p>And note, that the word of ſeruing the Image or idol is more generall then that other of bowing downe. For it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all idolatrous &amp; ſuperſtitious rights and ceremonies, &amp; all outward actions, geſtures &amp; ſignifications of zeale, reuerence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:182:33"/> or allowance of this kind of worſhip. Such are the dedicating of places for ſuch kind of worſhip, the erecting of altars, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of incenſe, lifting vp of the eyes to the Image, holding vp of the hands, vncouering the head before them, kiſſing of them, ſpeaking honorably of them, ſwearing by them, keeping holy dayes and feaſtes vnto them, conſecrating of Prieſts for them, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>As touching the Iewes, there was indeed a forme of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed by God, which was allowed of him, ſtanding in many godly rights and ceremonies, as the bookes of Moſes do plentifully declare. But now vnto Chriſtians, all thoſe rights and ceremonies which were peculiarly commaunded to the Iewes vntill the comming of Chriſt, they are ceaſſed. Only that which was morall to the Iewes, is remayning to the vſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with ſuch change of Sacraments as God himſelfe hath expreſſely commanded: Of which things we are to enquire anon.</p>

            <p>Now let vs go forward: Why doth the Lord in the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of idolatrie and falſe worſhip, recken vp ſo full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a diſtribution of the images &amp; likeneſſes of all kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſaying: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, nor the likneſſe of things which are in heauen aboue, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe all idolatrous nations, and namely the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, from whom the Lord had ſo lately deliuered the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and the Cananites with the reſt of the ſeauen nations, where he minded to giue them their dwelling place and to roote thoſe people out, had euery ſuch way corrupted and defiled, yea, vtterly peruerted the worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe the Lord knoweth the nature of all men to be exceedingly inclinable and ready to all kind of ſuperſtition and idolatry, in ſtead of yeelding true worſhip to the only true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade Iſa. 19.1. and Acts 17.22.23. &amp;c. 29. &amp; Rom. 1.21.22.23. reade alſo Deut. 6.14.</p>
            <p>And that all men are exceedingly proue to idolatry, Iſrael it ſelfe (who was moſt wiſely taught and inſtructed, and moſt earneſtly warned againſt it) may be one example in ſtead of all, ſeeing they did notwithſtanding by and by, after their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Egypt, yea and afterward from time to time, fall moſt groſly into it. Reade Exod. 32.1. &amp;c. 8.9. and Pſ. 106.19.20.21. and ver. 28.29. Reade alſo Iudg. 2.11.12.13. &amp; chap. 3.5.6.7.12. and chap. 4.1. Reade 1. King. 12.28. &amp;c. and Ier. chap. 2.5.6. &amp;c. and chap. 3.1. &amp;c. and verſes 6.7.8.9. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Iſrael would not take example from the iudgements of God vpon other nations, and namely vpon thoſe that were caſt out before them. Neither would the people of Iudah take warning by the wrath of God, which fell vpon Iſrael. Reade Ier. 11. ver.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:182:34"/> 12.13. reade Ezek. chap. 16. &amp; chap. 23. &amp; Iſa. 2.8. &amp; chapter 57.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Lord hath in other places of the Law, by expreſſe mention forbidden the religious making of all images in any kind of creature, either of wood carued: Iſa. 44. or of ſiluer &amp; gold, molten and caſt in a mold, as Exod. 20.23. or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mettall, Leuit. 19.4. or of ſtone, whether artificially faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or otherwiſe, Ier. 2.27. Iſa. 57.6. And not only the caruing, grauing, and melting of images for diuine worſhip, but alſo all painting of them either in glaſſe, or on walles, &amp; the expreſſing of them by needle worke, or any other way.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore we may ſee plainly the idolatries of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, all &amp; all ſorts of them, with euery ſuperſtitious appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereof, to be vniuerſally condemned by the Lord, in this ſecond Commandement.</p>
            <p>But doth the ſame condemnation belong to all the Popiſh and ſuperſtitious idolatries of thoſe, which do in words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to be the onely true Chriſtian and Catholike worſhippers of the true God, albeit they boaſt that they know and worſhip God in Chriſt, and not any ſtrange God, neither are ſo fooliſh (as they ſay) to thinke that the image is God, or to worſhip the croſſe but in reſpect of Chriſt, who was crucified vpon it, nor the bread in their Sacrament of the Altar, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as they ſay, and would ſeeme to beleeue) that it is then tranſubſtantiate into the very body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And albeit they do not yeeld their inferiour religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to falſe Saints, but to true Saints and their reliques &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents or rather to the Saints themſelues, and moſt of all to God in and for them, &amp;c. and albeit they haue their many cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſubtile excuſes and diſtinctions, whereby they would maintaine and vphold their wicked practiſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Are they (I ſay) neuertheleſſe (for all that they can ſay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this Law of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no doubt to be made, but they are all at once, and as it were by one breath of the moſt holy Spirit of God, vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea, ſo much the rather theſe then they, becauſe (as theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) they haue the knowledge of the true God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light of his word, which the other had not: For hereby their ſinne is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:182:34"/> made the greater, and they are left the more without excuſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as touching all the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wherby the idols of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; their idoll worſhip, is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in the holy Scriptures, they are as mighty &amp; preſſing to weigh downe &amp; ouerthrow all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and image-worſhip of our Popiſh Catholikes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true. For God retaineth the ſame nature and the ſame diuine properties ſtill, the which can no more be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed out now then they might then.</p>
            <p>He is a Spirit, as infinite and incomprehenſible as euer he was. And as touching Popiſh images, they are as vnable to do good or euill as the heatheniſh were.</p>
            <p>And they are as lying teachers, and the doctrine thereof as lying as the doctrine of the idoll hath at any time bene. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are called Laymens bookes, yet ſurely they teach nothing but ignorance, the mother of blind deuotion. And for no other cauſe do the Popiſh teachers commend them to thoſe from whom they haue of purpoſe taken away the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but that they might nouriſh in them an vtter neglect of reading the Scriptures in their knowne language, leaſt they ſhould come to any true knowledge by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherefore iuſtly are Chriſtians forwarned not only to withdraw themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all idols &amp; idolatries of the heathen in their more blind maner, and according to their groſſer ignorances, but alſo from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the example of the Iſraelites, which were more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be condemned becauſe of their knowledge. Reade 1. Cor. 10.7. Yea the Spirit of God giueth a more generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as 1. Iohn 5.21. Babes keepe your ſelues from idols, Amen: They be the laſt words of his Epiſtle, he hauing in the beginning warned them againſt Antichriſtian doctrine; ſuch as our Papiſts thruſt vpon the Churches of Chriſt. All which their falſe doctrine, and falſe worſhip, and that Antichriſtian power whereby it is exacted, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned vnder the title of the name, image and marke of the Beaſt of Rome, which all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to auoide, Reue. chap. 13.11.</p>
            <p>Yea this kind of idolatrie is ſo much the rather to be taken heed againſt, &amp; the more ſeuerely alſo to condemned, by how much it is more daungerous to bewitch and deceiue poore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:182:35"/> ignorant ſoules, and hath more ſhew of carnall reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſubtile heads may more plauſibly contend for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſame, according as the Apoſtle reaſoneth againſt the falſe Apoſtles, which made ſhew as if they had bene faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the Goſpell, where notwithſtanding they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly laboured to bring in the ceremonies of the Law, and the worſhipping of Angels, &amp; a Philoſophicall kind of preaching &amp;c. into the faith and worſhip of the Goſpell, 2. Cor. chap. 11.1. &amp;c. Col. chap. 2. and in the Epiſtle to the Galathians: But more to this purpoſe, reade Reue. chap. 17.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that which is truly ſayd of the Popiſh artolatrie or worſhip of the bread in their Sacrament of the Altar, that it is the moſt abominable idolatry of all other, becauſe it doth moſt nearly ouerthrow the truth of Religion, and the purity of the worſhip which God in it requireth, vnder the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion that may be: ſo may it be ſayd of the reſt of the Popiſh idolatrie, being compared with the idolatries of the heathen, which were more groſſe and further remoued from the appearance of true worſhip, which Popiſh worſhip ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue.</p>
            <p>And what though it pleaſed the Lord ſometime to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe and his holy Angels by outward ſimilitudes and likeneſſe of things, as of men, &amp;c. to Abraham, to Moſes, to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, to Ezekiel, to Daniel? Yet ſeeing Iſrael was forbidden to make any ſuch repreſentations to themſelues by the art of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, caſting in the mould, grauing, painting, needle worke, or any other way: it followeth by like ſtrength of good reaſon, that howſoeuer ſince that time the holy Ghoſt by the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of clouen tongues, and Chriſt being glorified after his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion ſhewed himſelfe to Paule and Iohn, and though before that, at the transfiguration of our Sauior Chriſt, Moſes &amp; Elias appeared in viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter Ieames &amp; Iohn; it followeth, I ſay, by like ſtrength of good reaſon, that they are not to be artificially pictured &amp; reſembled to any religious vſe and worſhip among Chriſtians, no more then the other were among the Iewes.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe while he was vpon the earth was not worſhipped with religious worſhip, but onely then, when he gaue ſome token of his diuine power and glory: And Paul
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:182:35"/> and Barnabas vehemently forbad all that diuine worſhip, which the heathen idolaters would haue honoured them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and Peter forbiddeth Cornelius, exceeding meaſure in his bowing to him: and the Angell forbiddeth Iohn to worſhip him, though he appeared in great glory before him; much leſſe are their images (though they were neuer ſo liuely and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pictured, ſet forth and aduanced) to be worſhipped with any religious worſhip, either higher or lower, with Doulia or Latria, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The onely pictures which the Lord alloweth, as ſeruing to teach and inſtruct in the right way of his worſhip, are his owne works, according to that in the 19. Pſal. 1. &amp;c. and Ioh. 5.17.36. and the preaching of the Goſpell, Rom. 10.18. by an alluſion to the former Scripture in the Pſal. and Gal. 3.1. Yet ſo, as the Lord will not haue the works of his owne hands worſhipped, but himſelfe onely who created and made them, according to the example of Abraham, Gen. 14.22. Reade alſo Deut. 4.19. Acts 17.24. and Ier. 8.1.2. and Zeph. 1.5.</p>
            <p>Finally, if we will pleaſe God in repreſenting his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie by any image, we our ſelues muſt be the image of him, walking in true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, according to his moſt righteous and holy lawes and commandements, which is our onely true wiſedome, whereby we are renewed according to the image of God, and ſhall ſhine as lights in the middeſt of a wicked generation.</p>
            <p>Hitherto therefore of the euill things forbidden in the ſecond Commandement:</p>
            <p>Now on the contrary I would gladly heare of you which are the good duties commanded?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the Lord commandeth that we willingly admit and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his owne word &amp; works, for our only rule of all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, &amp; to direct vs how he wilbe worſhipped &amp; ſerued, not only inwardly with ſpirituall worſhip, wherof we haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, but alſo in the outward declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; exerciſes therof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that from a wiſe, faithfull, louing, zealous, reuerend and dutifull heart, we do both priuately and publikely profeſſe, practiſe, &amp; aſmuch as lieth in vs, euery one in his calling &amp; place, both Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prince &amp; Magiſtrate, Miniſter of the word, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:182:36"/> euery other gouernour and maiſter of family,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> 
               <hi>both ioyntly as it were with one ſhoulder, and apart by euery mans particular inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and conſtancy in labour, to promote, further and aduance the ſame the diuine ſeruice and worſhip of God, according to the preſcript rule of his word. And that all of vs be carefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit our ſelues and helpe forward one another, in knowledge, faith, and repentance, and in all other ſpirituall graces, by the externall actions and exerciſes thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, God commandeth that we do very carefully ſhun, auoyd and watch againſt all meanes and occaſions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer would endanger vs to idolatry or any falſe ſuperſtitious worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that to the ſame end we hold our moſt neare friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and familiarity, and our onely religious Communion and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, with thoſe that profeſſe and declare themſelues to be the true worſhippers of God: we altogether conſtantly frequenting the places appointed for the holy aſſemblies and meetings of the people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, that euery of vs &amp; all with one conſent, chiefly the ciuill Magiſtrates and Miniſters of the Goſpell, ſhew &amp; approue our ſelues wiſely &amp; diſcretely zealous againſt all idolatry, &amp; euery point of falſe &amp; ſuperſtitious worſhip, to the quite aboliſhing and rooting of it out from among his people, to the vttermoſt of our power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that as touching indifferent things (as they are called) that is to ſay, ſuch things as be not of idolatrous &amp; ſuperſtitious inſtitution and inuention, but yet haue in their kind bene ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly &amp; idolatrouſly abuſed, &amp; be not of neceſſary vſe for the worſhip of God: that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate in commanding or not commanding, and the ſtronger Chriſtian, whether Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the word, or any other in the vſing or not vſing of them, be charitably wiſe and carefull, that thereby he giue no offence or cauſe of ſtumbling to the weake, and that they preiudice not the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libertie, wherwith Christ hath ſet vs free. And that the weaker &amp; more tender conſcienced Chriſtians, labour after that ſoundneſſe of knowledge &amp; perſwaſion in ſuch caſes &amp; actions as may well be conſtrued, that they ſtumble at no cauſleſſe offence, whereby their comfortable and zealous proceeding in the wayes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:182:36"/> of the Lords pure worſhip &amp; ſeruice ſhould be ſlacked or hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That according to the firſt part of this anſwer, the word of God, and his works both of creation and gouernement in the world, and alſo of regeneration and ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his Church, according to the inſtructions of the word, muſt be the rule of our knowledge, it may plainly be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe Scriptures following; in the which theſe things are oppoſed to all idols, and to euery carnall inuention and doctrine of man. Ezod. 23.13. Deut. 4.14.15.16. &amp;c. Iſa. 40.21. &amp;c. 31. and chap. 44.1.2.3.4.5.6.7. &amp;c. and Ier. 10.6.7.10.11.12.13.16. Zach. 13.1.2.3.4.5.6. Hoſh. 14.8.9.

And verily no wiſe man can thinke but Gods owne creatures and the works which he hath wrought in the nature of al things, are more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his eternal Godhead, &amp; of his diuine power, wiſedome, iuſtice, mercy, &amp;c. then the worke of any artificiall workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe worke is but a weake &amp; imperfect imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature: neither can he make ſo much as a ſhadow of the ſoule &amp; life &amp; vitall power or motion of any creature, &amp;c. The more alſo the ſenſes are caried after dumbe pictures and dead ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the leſſe groweth the care of reading and hearing of the liuely Scriptures themſelues: according as we ſee plainly in the Church of Rome, that by this meanes the diuell preuailed both to ſuppreſſe the holy Scriptures of God, and to bring in their owne lying Legends, to confirme their owne falſe worſhip, and all their lying doctrines.</p>

               <hi>They are the publike preaching and administration, reading, hearing, and receyuing of the word and Sacraments, ioyned with confeſſion of ſinnes, prayer, thankeſgiuing, ſinging of Pſalmes, &amp; execution of the iuſt cenſures of the Church diſcipline as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requireth, in that holy and chriſtian communion of Saints, whereunto God hath called hoth the Miniſters of his word, and alſo the reſt of his people in their ſeuerall congregations: and the priuate prayers and thankeſgiuings, with reading of the holy Scriptures, conferences, Catechiſings, and ſinging of Pſalmes in euerie Chriſtian familie, by the gouernours thereof, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants, according to the courſe of their priuate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: and the prayers and thankeſgiuings of euery member of the family apart by himſelfe, according to their particular occaſions and oportunities, both when he ſitteth downe, and when he riſeth vp from meate, when he lyeth downe and riſeth from his bed, when he iournieth abrode, and when he returneth home, when he falleth ſicke, and vvhen he recouereth his health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are the eſſentiall duties of Gods outward vvorſhip, both publike and priuate, whereunto we are to adde their accidents or adioyntes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reuerend and religious outward behauiour in all theſe holy actions, and namely in the confeſſion of ſinnes and prayer, the vncouering of the heade, the bowing of the knees, or riſing vp, if a man be ſet downe, holding vp the hands, lifting vp the eyes to heauen, with holy and reuerent boldneſſe of our faith in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God: or on the contrarie, looking dovvne to the earth, or couering the face, or ſtriking on the breaſt, or ſome other vvay in ſeemely manner, euen vvith teares ſometimes, as the caſe may require, declaring thereby our godly ſorrovv and anger againſt our ſelues for our ſinnes, as alſo fasting, ioyned vvith extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie humiliation by ſpeciall confeſſion of ſinnes and prayer, and faſting ioyned with speciall thankeſgiuing, according to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:182:38"/> and practiſe of the ſeruants of God, yea euen of whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and congregations of his people, layd before vs in the holy Scriptures to the ſame end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo: for theſe (as one may terme them) are a kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ceremonies, common and perpetuall both to the Iewes and Gentiles, and to all zealous and reuerend worſhippers of God from the beginning of the world, and ſo ſhall be to the end of the ſame: if there be no ſuch neceſſarie impediment or let, which in good diſcretion may hinder that particular pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe for a ſeaſon, or becauſe of ſome infirmitie or bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or defect in ſome particular perſons, who cannot do as otherwiſe gladly they would.</p>
            <p>But that we may ſpeake ſomething in order to both theſe anſwers ſo nearely lincked together, we are to vnderſtand that we haue both the inſtitution and alſo the practiſe of them confirmed by the vndoubted teſtimonie of the word of God, and by the practiſe of his faithfull ſeruants the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of him: Of the which let vs in a few words briefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For as touching the more full declaration of the chiefe of theſe things we haue partly ſeene before, and namely, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the preaching of the word what belongeth thereunto, and touching the reſt, that is, the Sacraments, prayer and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, with their extraordinarie faſting or feaſting, according to the ſeuerall occaſions thereof, we ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to treat more fully afterward by the grace of God.</p>
            <p>Briefly therefore touching the ground and inſtitution of the publike preaching and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, we ſee how after the inſtitution thereof in the Law, Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy 5.27.28. and chapter 10.15.16.17. Geneſis 17. &amp; Exodus 12. the charge of preaching the word, together with the change and new inſtitution of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, is renued to the Gentiles by our Sauiour Chriſt, Matth. 3. and chapter 26. and chapter 28. and 1. Corinthians 1.21. and of prayer both priuate and publike, Matth. chap. 6. and Luke 11. And thankeſgiuing, 1. Theſſal. 5.18.</p>
            <p>And for the practiſe of preaching, prayer, Sacraments, &amp;c. we may ſee it in our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles, Luke 3.21. and chap. 4.15. and chap. 6.12. Read alſo in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:182:38"/> Actes of the Apoſtles euerie where, and namely chapter 2.42. and chapter 20.17. &amp;c. and verſe 28. &amp;c. And for ſinging of Pſalmes, reade Mat. 26.30. Act. 2.47. Act. 16.25. Reade alſo 1. Cor. 14.26. Epheſ. 5.19.20. &amp; Coloſſ. 3.16. Reuel. 15.4.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe as touching the adioynts of the externall worſhip of God, ſee the practiſe of kneeling at prayer, Luke 22.41. Matth. 26.39. where our Sauiour Chriſt kneeleth downe, yea proſtrateth himſelfe on the ground. And Iohn 17.1. he lifteth vp his eyes to heauen. So did Paul and the Chriſtians with him when they prayed, Act. 20.36. and againe chapter 21.5. Reade alſo 1. Corinth. 14.25.</p>
            <p>For the vncouering of the head, reade 1. Cor. 11.4.</p>
            <p>For the holding vp of the hands in prayer, reade 1. Tim. 2.8. Exod. 17.11. Lament. 3.41.</p>
            <p>For faſting ioyned with prayer both priuate and publike, reade Mat. 6. and Luke 5.35. Act. 13.2. &amp; 2. Cor. 6.6.</p>
            <p>For looking downe to the earth, &amp;c. reade Luke. 18.13.14. and Ieremie 31.19. For teares in prayer, with pittie ouer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Luke 19.41. Philip. 3.18. Act. 20.37. 2. Tim. 1.4. Iudges chap. 2.4.5. 1. Sam. 7.6. Pſal. 6.6. &amp; 56.8. and Pſalme. 119. verſ. 136. &amp; 2. Kings 20.3. &amp; ch. 22.19. &amp; Ezra ch. 10.1. Ioel 2.17.</p>
            <p>For feaſting and ioyfulneſſe with ſpeciall thankſgiuing, read Iude verſe 12. and 1. Corinth. 11.20.21.</p>
            <p>And in this maner was it that Paul ſaith, Act. 24 14. that he worſhipded God, beleeuing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</p>
            <p>It is true indeede, that the bowing of the bodie and all other outward geſtures are nothing without the bowing of the hart, as we may perceiue by the ſpeech of Ioſhua, chap. 24.23. &amp; 1. Kings 8.57.58. and Iſaiah 58.5. But how can we thinke that ſuch a one boweth his heart, who refuſeth to make anie outward profeſſion of it in the fit time and place thereof?</p>
            <p>Euerie one therefore that will, may ſee that theſe things (though they be not of the ſubſtance of religion) yet may they not be profanely and rudely neglected of vs, without ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this holy commandement of God. And we are the rather to conſider of theſe things, becauſe experience ſheweth, that manie fall from Popiſh ſuperſtition, to a contrarie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:182:39"/> extremitie of vnreuerend behauiour before the Lord, as thogh it nothing at al mattered what geſture we vſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. This is no correction of abuſes, but a chaunging of one abuſe for another, and therefore muſt needes be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing before the Lord.</p>
            <p>But yet one thing more, which I pray you let vs earneſtly &amp; in the feare of God, concerning the miniſtration of the word and Sacraments: that is, whether it be neceſſarie, that there be anie preſcript forme ſet downe and agreed vpon, for the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe actions, and that the ſame ſhould be religiouſly vſed in the worſhip of God, or no. For verily it is neceſſarie that euerie one haue a ſound iudgement and perſwaſion in this point, and that we haue a cleare conſcience void of all ſcruple, ſeeing it doth ſo nearely concerne the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore what hath beene your inſtruction herein: &amp; I beſeech God to giue vs true vnderſtanding in all things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue bene taught, that it is not ſimply neceſſarie, that there ſhould he anie preſcribed forme, for then the Lord himſelfe would by his holy Apostles haue expreſly ſet dovvne one for an vnchangeable and exact rule for all Chriſtian Churches. And beſide, it may be preſuppoſed, that he vvhich (according to the ordinance of the Lord) is fit to be a Miniſter of the vvord and Sacraments, is in ſome conuenient meaſure inſtructed from the booke of God, hovv to pray in all things as the matter requireth, as vvell as to teach euerie man the vvhole doctrine of faith, and to inſtruct in euerie point of righteouſneſſe, through the vviſedom and grace of the holy Ghoſt vvhich is giuen vnto him. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the giftes and graces of the Spirit of God are not to be ſtinted and limited by man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neuertheleſſe, I haue here vvithall bene likevviſe taught, that in ſome reſpects it may be counted neceſſarie, as a godly helpe and remedie, both for Miniſters and people, that they ſhold haue ſome forme and order agreed vpon, and vſed for publike profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſent; prouided that it be a ſound collection and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation out of the vvord of God, both for the ſubſtance of matter, and alſo touching the forme and order it ſelfe, as graue and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as may be, without all curious varietie of humane inuention, according to the examples and practiſes of the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:182:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> recorded and ſet dovvne in the vvord of God for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein: ſo that the libertie of the preaching of the Goſpell, and of the prayer vvhich is by the diſcretion of the Preacher to be fitted thereunto, be not by the length and labour of that vvhich is preſcribed, abridged, or preiudiced and hindred anie vvay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of theſe things, reade 2. Timothie 3.16.17. 1. Peter 4.11. Coloſſ. 1.28. 1. Corinth. 11.1. &amp;c. to the end, and chap. 14. Act. 13.15.27. and chap. 15.21. and Coloſſ. 4.16. 2. Timothie 4.1.2.3.4.5.</p>
            <p>See ſome examples of preſcribed formes in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Of Prayer, Pſalme 102. Ioel 2.15.16.17.18. Luke chap. 11.2. of thankeſgiuing, Deut. 26.5.6.7.8.9.10. Pſalme 92.2. Chron. 29.30. Reuelation 15.3. Of bleſsing, Nombers 6.22. &amp;c. Yea of bleſsing the godly, and curſing the wicked, Deuter. 27.11.12. Reade alſo Nombers 5.21.22.</p>
            <p>Theſe examples and the like, are to be followed for ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, plaineneſſe and breuitie, in a meete and conuenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Otherwiſe, none ought to preſume either to preſcribe or practiſe anie thing for a worſhip yeelded to God.</p>
            <p>But which are thoſe reſpects for the which a preſcript forme and order of the miniſtration of the word and Sacraments, may be accounted neceſſarie, as a godly helpe and remedie to be agreed vpon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in regard of the vveaker ſort in euerie congregation, vvho are neceſſarily herein to be tendered of all the reſt; yea euen in reſpect of the common infirmity &amp; humane vveakneſſe of vs al.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe of the importunitie of the malitious aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the Goſpell, vvho vvould othervviſe take great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to cauill at, and to ſlaunder the Churches of God, as if vve vvere vncertaine in all things, and vvere full of confuſion in our faith and vvorſhip of God, and in our vvhole profeſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the weaker ſort of our brethren, we know how they are in manie places offended, yea notwithſtanding the faithfull Miniſters of God vſe good diſcretion herein. They are hardly kept from waywardneſſe againſt preaching it ſelf, which God hath appointed to do them the moſt good, becauſe they are not fully ſatisfied the other way. But beſide this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:182:40"/> of the weaker, ſurely they that are more ſtrong and better confirmed in the wayes of God, and haue the grace to diſcern betwixt things that differ (both Miniſter of the word and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) they find good vſe of that which is well preſcribed both for prayer and for declaration of other the ordinances of God, not onely for helpe of memorie, but alſo to quicken the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the more excellent, more neceſſarie, more eſſentiall, &amp; effectuall parts of their miniſterie: wherein God is to be bleſſed and prayſed of vs, for our gracious libertie, both touching prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and alſo concerning prayer, ſo far as God hath diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meaſure of his graces to euery one.</p>
            <p>Thus far therefore all are to be intreated in the Lord, that howſoeuer euerie one is for his owne part, to keepe him ſelfe vpright and ſincere in the worſhip of God, yet where ſome things are amiſſe, in an order ſet down which is generally good and godly, we are to take great heed that we ſin not ſo vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, as to reiect all becauſe of ſome imperfections. Neither yet to be ouer readie to obiect and hold forth the blemiſhes thereof to the diſgracing of the whole, &amp; therein to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, &amp;c: but rather to ſigh and mourne for it, &amp; to intreat the Lord for his mercifull redreſſe in his due time, we alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our ſelues vnworthie of ſo great perfection as we ought humbly to deſire and heartily to long for, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Hence it is, that (as it followeth in the reaſon of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) the Lord taketh to himſelfe the title of iealouſie againſt Idolaters, as againſt thoſe which defile the mariage co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: of the which reaſon we are now to inquire. It contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two partes. Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is a threatning of the curſe against all Idolaters, vvhich the Lord accompteth haters of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is, a promiſe of bleſſing to all pure and chaſt vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God, vvhome onely he eſteemeth for his true louers &amp; friends, according as it is ſayd of Abraham, that he vvas called the friend of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeede we reade Iames 2.23 And the Apoſtle may well gather ſo much by the Lords familiar dealing with Abraham, as the holy ſtorie plentifully reporteth, ſeeing he was a true worſhipper of him, &amp;c. reade 2. Chron. 20.7. &amp; Iſa. ch. 4.18.</p>
            <p>But in the reaſon of the commandement, which are the words of the curſe againſt Idolaters?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe: For I the Lord thy God mighty and iealous, do viſite the iniquitie of the Fathers vpon the Children, vpon the third generation, and vpon the fourth, on ſuch as hate me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What meaneth the Lord when he ſaith, he will viſite the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the fathers on the children?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His meaning is, that he will ſeuerely puniſh this grieuous ſin of Idolatrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God indeede doth not viſite and make inquiſition for ſin in vaine; but finding it he taketh vengeance of it, as we may obſerue his proceeding againſt Sodome and Gomorrha, and the cities adioyning, Gen. 18.20.21. and chapter 19.23. Read the 1. chapter of Zephaniah, where the threatning of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is ioyned with the viſitation and ſearch for ſinne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe times in that chapter. And the Lord profeſſeth himſelfe ſpecially wroth, as we ſee in this place againſt this ſinne of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, which he accounteth a ſpiritual and moſt filthie forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

            <p>But why doth God call Idolaters haters of him, ſeeing they ſay they do that which they do of ſingular loue, deuotion, and zeale which they beare vnto him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe Idolaters can no more loue God in truth, then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous woman can loue her husband, howſoeuer ſhe ſpeaketh him faire and flattereth with her lippes.</hi>

            <p>This indeede doth the Lord giue all Idolaters plainely to vnderſtand, if they had grace to ſee.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>It is rather of wonderfull mercie, that he doth ſo graciouſly limite and restraine the curſe: ſeeing he might iuſtly withdraw his grace from the whole poſteritie of the Idolaters, as from an illegitimate and baſtardly ſeede, ſeeing he hath aſmuch as in him lyeth, made the condition of the couenant of this ſpirituall mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age vtterly voyd and frustrate.</hi>

For the loue of God in vs is the immediate roote and fountaine of all our obedience, euen as his loue toward vs and the ſweetneſſe thereof apprehended and felt in our harts by faith, is the original &amp; firſt cauſe of our loue to him. But ſhall all the poſteritie of the true worſhippers of God be thus bleſſed and ſaued without exception?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No: but they onely which keepe couenant with the Lord, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of their faithfull and godly parents, how few or how manie ſoeuer they be.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Remember Ezechiel againe 18.14. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what if the children of faithfull parents dye before they know what belongeth to the true worſhip of God, neither haue knowledge and faith to loue him and to keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is notwithſtanding very comfortable hope, becauſe they are vvithin the compaſſe and charter of the couenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for God hath fayd of the faithfull worſhippers of him: I am thy God and the God of thy ſeede, Geneſis 17.17. and chapter 12.2. And our Sauiour Chriſt aſſureth vs, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:182:43"/> to ſuch belongeth the kingdome of heauen, Marke 10.14. reade alſo 1. Corinthians 7.14.</p>
            <p>Yet we ſee that euen of the children of the faithfull, manie that liue to come to knowledge, do afterward vtterly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and refuſe to walke in the ſteppes of their faithfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſo pull downe the curſe of God vpon their heades: yea the true worſhippers of God themſelus, &amp; their godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue alwayes, and do ſtill meete with manie great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles, according as it is ſaid: Great are the troubles of the righteous, Pſal. 34.19.</p>
            <p>What is to be ſaid to theſe things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hereby giueth to vnderſtand, that his election is free, and alſo that all mankind is naturally corrupt and ſinfull from the vvombe, and that the obedience of his beſt ſeruants is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, vvhich maketh the iarre, and putteth all as it vvere out of time. So that of neceſſitie vve muſt haue recourſe to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Gods free grace and mercie in Chriſt Ieſus, for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ground of our ſtay &amp; comfort in the midſt of al our troubles, vntill the Lord ſhall in his good time deliuer vs out of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is in the place of the Pſal. before mentioned: Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of them all. Vndoubtedly, if we could hold on in an euen and conſtant courſe of obedience, his mercies toward vs ſhold flow as it were with a continuall ſtreame vpon vs without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; but becauſe we go ſo often out of the way, we meete with the curſe, at the leaſt with the tagge of it (as one may ſay) in ſteade of the bleſſing. Now therefore theſe things being true, both touching the curſe and alſo the bleſſing (as they are indeede moſt true) how commeth it to paſſe that they do vſually ſo litle affect people, either to breede in them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to flie idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhip, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them to be vpright &amp; zealous in the true worſhip &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. What is the cauſe of this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is, by reaſon that we do not conſider duly of that which God himſelf alledgeth, to admoniſh and prouoke vs all, to be aboue all things moſt careful to yeeld him his moſt due ſeruice &amp; worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is that which God alledgeth to this end?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His almighty power &amp; eternal decree, wherin he ſtandeth fully
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:182:43"/> armed and most zealouſly bent, both with iustice to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon al Idolaters, and alſo in mercie to bleſſe and reward all his true worſhippers and faithfull ſeruants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things which are moſt weightie and of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance aboue all other, are contained in thoſe his diuine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which here againe the Lord repeateth from the preface or generall reaſon of his Law; ſaying: For I the Lord thy God: and in this new title of iealouſie which he taketh to himſelfe, by a ſimilitude taken from the diſpoſition of a moſt louing husband, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaſt indure to be vnfaithfully dealt withall by his wife aboue all other, and is a moſt hote purſuer of him which hath defiled his mariage bed, as we reade Prouerbes 6. in the end of the chapter: God grant that all of vs may better conſider of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Why is Idolatry compared to bodily adultery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, to ſet forth how abominable this ſin is in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, to note the extreame delight and pleaſure which Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters take in this ſottiſh haunt, they being as it were wood and mad in the haunting after it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe they are by all meanes moſt lauiſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall in the vpholding and aduancement of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, becauſe the ſpirituall adulterer as well as the bodily, is continually reſtleſſe and vnſatisfied, ſeeing they haue both of them left the wayes of God, whereunto onely he hath promiſed the bleſſing of ſacietie and contentment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the firſt reaſon, we haue ſeene it alreadie from the 16. chapter, and the 23. chap. of Ezek. where the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth it ſo odiouſly, that (were it not that the Lord hath ſeene it ſo meet) we wold think that it might not with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe be ſo vttered. But the reuerence of his moſt holy and pure wiſedome teacheth vs, to lay all the ſhame iuſtly vpon our owne extreame folly, which hath giuen ſo vehement an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond and third reaſon, their owne practiſe in their often and long pilgrimages, their manie and great offerings &amp; gifts, both in life and at their death, their coſtly decking of their images, &amp;c. are a plentifull and reall witneſſe, famous as in a theater. &amp;c.</p>

               <note place="margin">Euerie man is a damnable tranſgreſſor.</note>Laſt of all, that they are reſtleſſe and vnſatisfied and neuer quieted, it is affirmed Pſ. 16. and may be gathered, by the name which the Lord giueth in manie places, calling them, <hi>terricula,</hi> ſuch things as rather terrifie and vexe, then comfort, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the interpretation and equitie, and of the curſe and bleſſing of this ſecond commandement:</p>
            <p>Now that we may come to the vſe, and ſo as ſhortly as may be, grow to the concluſion.</p>
            <p>Haue you perfectly obeyed this ſo iuſt and equall a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that therby you ſtand freed from the curſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that ye may (as a recompence of your obedience) looke for the bleſſings promiſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſpeake truely, neither I nor anie other can ſay ſo: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all of vs do grieuouſly and continually ſin againſt it one way or other. It is the onely mercie and grace of God, vvherby vve are preſerued from groſſe idolatrie and the occaſions thereof; and that vve are taught &amp; trayned vp in the vvay of his true vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And if vve could rightly iudge our ſelues, vve ſhould find, that by nature vve are as prone and readie to all ſuperſtition &amp; Idolatry, as any other which haue bene this way miſled before vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for idolatrie is very pleaſing to the naturall man, as that which is of his owne deuiſing, and which man hath himſelfe euery way fitted to ſerue his owne humor.<note place="margin">Suum cuique pulchram.</note> It hath all things delightfull to the ſight of the eyes, to the hearing of the eares, to the ſmelling of the noſe, goodly and ſumptuous Churches and monaſteries, beautifull and braue Images, ſweet melodie and deſcant, fragrant and odoriferous ſmels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. To ſpeake in a word, it is a maruellous and eaſie way of worſhipping God, according to that which one ſaith of their moſt deuoted and religious perſons, that they are humble but without lowlineſſe, poore but without want, and rich without labour. It were doubtleſſe an eaſie thing for any of vs, to bring our hearts to as great a loue and liking of idolatrie and idolatrous worſhip as any of the Papiſts beare vnto it, if the commandement of God did not through his grace reſtraine vs, and informe our conſciences againſt it: So that they which boaſt and glorie of their deuotion this way, they do but glory of their owne ſhame.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:182:44"/>
            <p>The temptations of groſſe Idolatrie (Go be thanked) are not of anie great force with vs in this our gracious peace and libertie of the Goſpell.<note place="margin">Chriſts perfect obedience for vs</note> But which of vs knoweth how great they would be, if Idolatrie (which God of his infinite mercie forbid) might yet againe be countenanced &amp; commanded by publike authoritie, and enforced by ſeuere perſecution and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty: we may be ſure of this, that vnleſſe we ſhould be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted by the Spirit of God to withſtand them, they would fearefully ſhake vs. Wherefore let vs not deceiue our ſelues with vaine confidence, without carefull ſifting and examining of our ſelues in the ſight of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to leaue coniectures for the time to come, and to go no further then to preſent ſignes and ſhew tokens; ſurely the litle ſorrow which we haue for our former ſinnes in the dayes of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous darkeneſſe, and the litle thankfulneſſe that is among vs for the ſweet and comfortable light of the Goſpell, with ſo wonderfull deliuerance as we enioy: and finally that litle reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and zeale which we beare to the true worſhip of God in the holy and pure exerciſes thereof, they do ſtrongly eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and teſtifie againſt vs, that our ſin and guiltineſſe is great againſt the righteouſneſſe of this holy Commandement.</p>
            <p>We are therefore ſo farre from the deſert of bleſſing, that we haue deſerued a great meaſure of the curſe; and might iuſtly feare it without all eſcape, vnleſſe happily we ſhall take hold of that part of the obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt, whereby he hath obeyed this Law, and made ſatisfaction to God for our ſins in this behalfe: for he onely muſt be our diſcharge, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>We haue a notable proofe of it in the</hi> 2. <hi>ch. of the Euang. Iohn, verſ.</hi> 14.15.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>which teſtifieth of his perfect zeale againſt the abuſes, &amp; for the right vſe of the holy place of Gods worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rehearſe that which he Euangeliſt writeth of this matter.</p>
            <p n="14">14 <hi>And he found in the Temple thoſe that ſold oxen, &amp; ſheep, and doues, and changers of monie ſitting there.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This zeale of our Sauiour Chriſt for the houſe of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is indeede a perfect confirmation of his zeale to all the duties of Gods worſhip, to be performed in all holy and pure manner in the Temple of God, according as it is ſaid in the Pſal. 93.5. Holineſſe becommeth thine houſe O Lord for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and Pſalme 5.7. I will come into thy houſe in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy mercie, &amp;c. and Pſalm. 29.9. In his Temple ſhould euerie man ſpeake of his glorie. And according as the Iſraelites returning from captiuitie, Nehem. chapter 10.39. in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of their oth and vow to the Lord expreſſe it by this, that they would not forſake the houſe of their God.</p>
            <p>Neither did our Sauiour Chriſt once onely in this maner of reforming the Temple, vtter this his perfect zeale in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his miracles and ſhewing himſelfe, but alſo toward the end of his courſe, as we reade Matth. 21.12. &amp;c. and. Luk. 19. verſ. 45.46.47. And let vs the rather obſerue the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the zeale of our Sauiour Chriſt, becauſe he vſeth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and ſharpe cenſure againſt that which (though it was a great profanation of the Temple) yet it had great colour of carnall reaſon to ſet a gloſſe and faire ſhew vpon it. For there was vſe of all thoſe things in the worſhip of God; that ſuch as wold offer ſacrifices either greater or ſmaller, might haue them at hand there, &amp; alſo their monie of what coyne ſoeuer chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged there, for the buying of their ſacrifices, &amp;c. The perfection therefore of the zeale of our Sauiour Chriſt may hence be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that no ſhew of excuſe could ſlack his iuſt cenſure and vehement reproofe. He was ſo wholly taken vp with the true zeale of Gods worſhip, that he doth as it were trample vnder his feet all carnall reaſon, &amp; ſpecially the filthy couetouſnes of the Prieſts, which was in them a chief cauſe of the tolleration of this abuſe.</p>
            <p>But beſide this one, &amp; that alſo a dobled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we haue

For they are ſo many warrants of his fulfilling of this, becauſe in them he hath ioynt-witneſſe both of his internall and externall worſhip together. Neither is it to be omitted here, that our Sauiour Chriſt vſually frequented the Sinagogues of the Iewes, and Temple of Ieruſalem, at the times of the holy feaſts: partly to celebrate the feaſts according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God: and partly to manifeſt himſelfe to be the Lord our righteouſneſſe, and to publiſh the doctrine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the moſt ſolemne aſſemblies of the people of God. Wherefore alſo we are hereby likewiſe further confirmed, that the Lord who hath in Chriſt Ieſus accepted a ſatisfaction for our ſinnes againſt this Commandement as well as againſt the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will for his perfect obedience ſake, accept of our poore endeuour and labour, if from our hearts we ſtriue to worſhip him in ſome meaſure, both of inward truth, &amp; alſo of outward profeſſion and declaration of his worſhip, and alſo make vs partakers of his bleſſing, promiſed both to our ſelues and our children, euen to ſo many as ſhall yeeld him any meaſure of true ſeruice and obedience.</p>

            <p>This is indeed the generall ſcope and drift of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, according to the generall inſtructions and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhortations of the word of God, ſhewing how the life of the ſeruants of God ſhould differ from the life of all prophane and worldly ones, both in the manner and forme of it, and alſo in the ende which they ought to propound to themſelues therein: ſuch as are the inſtructions, &amp;c. which we may reade Math. 5.16. 1. Peter chapter 2.12. and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 3.15.16. and chap. 4.1.2.3.4.

            <p>And it was neceſſarie that the Lord ſhould adde this Commaundement, to ſuch ende and purpoſe as hath beene
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:182:46"/> thus declared, that thereby he might meete with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie or lightneſſe and vanity of a number, who deſiring not to be accounted altogether prophane and without Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, do therefore come to the place of Gods worſhip, and ſit downe or ſtand vp to heare the Sermon, and kneele downe to prayer, &amp;c. yet the ſame neuertheleſſe ſo ſoone as they are out of the Church-doore, let all their thoughts and words, and the whole courſe of their life looſe to a kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This the Lord cannot endure, it being an vnworthy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable profeſſion of his name and Religion: yea, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it no better then a defiling of his name, as we may reade Leuit. 22. verſes 31.32.33. and chap. 20.3. The polluting of his name, &amp; the defiling of his ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary, the place of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they are ioyned together.

            <p>The Lord requireth of his worſhippers to take another courſe. He cannot like that we ſhould vnder couert of his name follow our owne vaine minds and luſts, neither yet one to ſooth and flatter another by an Italienate behauiour, &amp;c. after the manner of this world, which is full of ſubtility and glozing; but in ſimplicity and truth, &amp;c. as we haue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deſcription of a right godly life, 2. Cor. 6.4.5.6.7.8.9.10. and Iames 3.17.18. The life of the true worſhipper of God, is not ſychophanticall and effeminate, but it is cordiall &amp; without hypocriſie or guile.

            </p>
            <p>Touching the firſt of theſe points, let vs conſider that it is the very vſe of a name to put difference betwixt one thing and another, and ſpecially betwixt the creature and the Creator, Reade Exod. 34.5.6.7.

               </gap>ame and fame, reade Micah. 6.9. and Pſalme 20 8. and Iſa. 29.23. To ſanctifie the name of God, and to ſanctifie the holy one of Iaacob, is all one. As alſo in the Lords prayer, Hallowed be thy name. And finally, for this cauſe it is, that whatſoeuer is attributed to the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is aſcribed to his name: as Zach. 14.9. One Lord, and his name is one. And euery where in the holy Scriptures his name is ſayd to be eternall, and to endure for euer; to be holy, to be glorious, to be fearefull, and to be mightie, both for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his ſeruants, Prouerbs 18.10. and for the ouerthrow of his and their aduerſaries, Pſalme 44.5. and Pſalme 118.10.11.12.</p>
            <p>The reſt of this point is plaine by that which hath bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayd.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore go forward.</p>
            <p>What is it to take the name of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The name of God is taken of vs, two manner of vvayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew how that is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Either in ſpeech, and by woid of mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or in profeſſion of Religion, and vſuall courſe and trade of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, for firſt in ſpeech we take the name of God, in ſuch ſenſe as we ſay a man taketh vp a ſaying, ſentence, or prouerbe, when he vttereth and ſpeaketh the ſame: according to the ſame vſe of this phraſe of ſpeech, Amos chap. 5.1. &amp; Pſa. 16.4. and Numb. chap. 23. and chap. 24. ſundry times Balaam tooke vp or vttered his parable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And touching the ſecond kind of taking the name of God, in the profeſſion of his name and religion, and in the vſuall courſe of our life, reade Acts 9.15. Ieremie chapter 15.16.

            <p>And are we not all baptized into the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt?</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is meete that all ſhould liue to the glory of his name, as we are afterward further to conſider, reade Micah. 4.5. and Zach. 14.20.21.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Ier. chap. 15. verſe 16. and Ioel. 2.17. and Mal. 2.7. and 1. Cor. 4.1. where we ſee how Miniſters of the word of God beare his name.</p>
            <p>And for ciuill Magiſtrates, reade Pſal. 82. I haue ſayd yee are Gods, or mighty ones, that is, powers ordained of God, as the Apoſtle Paule calleth them, Rom. 13. yea, 1. Cor. 7.22.

            <p>Now therefore in the meane while what is it to take the name of God in vaine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is either by word of mouth ſo lightly and vnreuerendly to ſpeake of God, his title, vvord, or vvorks, and namely by vaine oathes &amp; accuſtomed ſwearing and vowing; or elſe in the courſe of life and conuerſation, to vvalke ſo ſlowly, indiſcretly, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtantly, or any other way ſo vnbeſeeming the profeſſion of the name of God, that God hath no glory, but rather is diſhonoured by any in his ſeuerall vocation and calling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And among theſe looſe liuers, the name of God is ſo much the more vnworthily taken in vaine, by how much any hauing more ſpeciall gouernment and charge ouer others, either in publike or priuate gouernement, do neuertheleſſe leaue them to their owne liberty, to talke &amp; to walke according to their owne vaine minds and affections, vvithout due restraint and correction: Yea, though they run not by and by into any notable extremity &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, either in word or in deed.</hi>

            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:182:48"/>
            <p>Againſt idle, light, fooliſh, and ieſting ſpeeches, as it is the diſpoſition of ſome to delight in merry inuectiues againſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to put off all graue and religious communication by pleaſant conceipts, &amp;c. Reade Math. 12.36.37. and Epheſ. 5.4. and Eccle. chap. 11.9. Theſe things do not beſeeme the ſeruants of God, who ought to be ſober and graue in all their ſpeech &amp; communication, as hereafter will appeare. See Pſal. 106.33.

            <p>Againſt vaine oathes and accuſtomable ſwearing, reade Math. 5.24. &amp;c. and Iames 5.12.</p>
            <p>Againſt looſeneſſe of life, and the actions thereof in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, reade 1. Sam. 15.13.14.15. the example of Saule Conſider it alſo in the example of Demas, 2. Tim. 4.10.</p>
            <p>The reſt of this anſwer is euident from that which hath bene already alledged.</p>
            <p>Only it ſeemeth neceſſary in this place to giue ſome ſpeciall admonition againſt the abuſe of Gods name, by ſhewing how manifold wayes it may be, and is vſually abuſed of vs in our common ſpeeches. For the which, reade Virell in his Treatiſe of the principles and grounds of Religion, page 121. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this third Commandement.</p>
            <p>But is there nothing elſe forbidden in this Commandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing the Lord forbiddeth all negligent regard of giuing glory to the name of God, in honeſt, lawfull, &amp; holy callings, &amp; by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaine oathes and vowes, or by making any irreuerend men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the name of God in ſpeeches, otherwiſe tollerable and good: it must needs be, that he doth much rather condemne all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and vngodly callings, all apoſtacie, and falling from the truth and profeſſion of his name, all ſwearing by that which is not God, all periuries and blaſphemies, together vvith all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pollutions of God his moſt holy and glorious name, in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enterludes, in dice-play, in fortune telling, in charmings, in ſorceries, coniuration, and vvitchcraft, vvhether tending to finding or looſing, to healing or to hurting by the helpe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and likewiſe all wrathfull curſing and banning of others, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or any other creature, vvith all raſh imprecations and vviſhes againſt our ſelues, and euery other like notorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe vvhatſoeuer it be.</hi>

            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:182:49"/>
            <p>It muſt needes be ſo: for the which reade Pſalme 58.16. &amp;c. to the end of the Pſalme: reade alſo Mal. 1.6.7.8. And if negligence or lightneſſe, and in diſcretion in lawfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly callings, be a taking of Gods name in vaine, how much more do they ſinne, who are ſhameleſly bold and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, fierce and raging, or fraudulent and crafty, in wicked and vngodly profeſſions and practiſes, whether in falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as Reuelation chapter 9. or in mechanicall crafts, as touching thoſe whom the Apoſtle calleth inuenters of euill things, Rom. 1.30.</p>
            <p>Seeing vaine ſpeeches, oathes and vowes be abuſes of Gods name, much more all blaſphemous ſpeeches, wicked oathes and vowes, and the performance of them: ſuch as were the oathes and vowes of Herod, and of thoſe that vowed to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Paule, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Seeing the vſing of good meanes with truſt in them (as Aſa looked to much after Phiſicke) is a taking of Gods name in vaine, then it is a more haynous abuſe to ſeeke to falſe gods, as Ahaziah did 2. Kings chap. 1. and all that ſeeke to ſorcerers, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as are conſorted with the Diuell, yea, how faire pretences ſoeuer they make, as though they cured by the name of God, or by vſing good words.</p>

            <p>The force of this kind of reaſoning which hath now bene vſed, is plaine to euery one that will vnderſtand, ſo that we need not ſtand longer to perſwade it: Let vs therefore go forward, and come to the other part of the interpretation, that we may ſee what good duties are commanded.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is very true: for if we ſhall not in ſuch caſe giue glory to God, as Ioſua chargeth and exhorteth Achan, Ioſ. 7.19. God will in his iuſtice refuſe to ſhew vs mercy, reade Iſai. 30.1. &amp; Pro. 28.13. ſo likewiſe if we ſhall not for feare or ſhame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>If they will learne the wayes of my people (ſaith the Lord) to ſweare by my name, The Lord liueth, as they taught my people to ſweare by Baal: then ſhall they be built in the midſt of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ieremie chapter</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>What is the bleſſing of God belonging to a religious &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous care of honouring the name of God, with a godly life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the holy profeſſion of his bleſſed religion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Them that honour me I will honour, ſaith the Lord,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam. chapter</hi> 2.30.</p>
            <p>What is the bleſſing of thoſe that be not onely carefull them ſelues in their owne perſons to glorifie God, but alſo hauing gouernement ouer others, be carefull of them alſo; yea and to further and draw on all other (ſo manie as they can) to honour the name of God together with themſelues?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they that turne manie to righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for euer and euer, Dan. chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>And in the Propheſie of Malac. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſes</hi> 16.17.18. <hi>The Lord (ſaith he) hath a booke of remembrance to record the names of ſuch.

            </p>
            <p>To conclude this point of the bleſsings of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: What is the bleſsing of conſtancie in the profeſsion of the name and religion of God in the midſt of perſecutions, and euen to the death of martyrdome it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed are they which ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 5.10. <hi>and verſes</hi> 11.12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are moſt comfortable &amp; gracious bleſsings, &amp; whoſe heart may they not worthily allure to enter into this courſe of true wiſedome, glorie, and happineſſe, whoſoeuer haue anie ſparke of grace and true wiſedome in them?</p>
            <p>But alas it may be ſaid, that in ſo much as the Law promiſeth not any bleſsing, but vpon condition of perfect obedience: and ſeeing we are all, yea euen they that haue receiued greateſt grace, greatly behind and much failing therein (that we ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe that are ſo farre from the courſe both of ſpeech and life here commanded, that they reioyce in wickedneſſe, &amp; thinke themſelues to remember God the better, when they ſweare and rap out all the othes they can thinke on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the obedience of this commandement as too great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe, and to be an hypocriticall holineſſe, &amp;c.) what ſhall we ſay for our reliefe againſt thoſe ſo great diſcomforts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though our failings, yea though our rebellions haue bene great againſt this holy Commandement, ſo as we may iuſtly look to meete with the curſes, and not to haue our part in any of the bleſſings: yet Gods mercie in Chriſt Ieſus is greater then our ſins, and his bloud ſhall waſh away both them and the guiltineſſe of them, not onely from the eye of Gods iuſtice, but alſo from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation and prickings of our owne conſciences, if we ſhall tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue in his name, that he hath ſatisfied for theſe our ſins, and fulfilled this part of obedience for vs; and if we ſhall heartily repent and be henceforth more carefull, both with the words of our mouthes, and alſo in the actions of our liues to glorifie the name of God, then hitherto we haue bene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our onely comfort indeed, according to that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe of our Sauiour Chriſt, Matth. 12.31.32.</p>
            <p>But what proofe haue you, that Chriſt hath not onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for theſe our ſinnes, but alſo hath fulfilled the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obedience of this Commandement for vs, ſo as the Lord will be moued for his ſake to forgiue our ſinnes, and to accept and to bleſſe our vnperfect and vnworthie obedience?</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:182:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obedience for vs</note> 
               <hi>vvho is most faithfull and true, giueth a plentifull vvitneſſe of it in the</hi> 17. <hi>chapter of the Goſpell vvritten by his holy Euangeliſt Saint Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Chapter is notable to this purpoſe, being a moſt heauenly prayer of our Sauiour Chriſt, to his (and thorough him) our heauenly Father, for his whole Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But let vs heare the principall words tending to this end?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 4. <hi>verſe our Sauiour Christ ſaith thus: I haue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thee on earth, I haue finiſhed the vvorke vvhich thou gaueſt me to do. And verſe</hi> 6. <hi>I haue declared thy name vnto the men vvhich thou gaueſt me out of the vvorld: thine they vvere, and thou gaueſt them me, and they haue kept thy vvord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And verſe</hi> 11.12. <hi>And novv am I no more in the vvorld, but theſe are in the vvorld, and I come vnto thee. Holy Father keepe them in thy name, euen them vvhome thou haſt giuen me, that they may be one as vve are. While I vvas in the vvorld, I kept them in thy name, thoſe vvhome thou gaueſt me I haue kept, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And verſes</hi> 15.16.17. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the vvorld, but that thou keep them from euill. They are not of the vvorld, as I am not of the vvorld. Sanctifie them vvith thy truth, thy vvord is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the laſt verſe of the chapter: I haue declared to them thy name, and vvill declare it, that the loue vvherevvith thou haſt loued me may be in them and I in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here indeed we ſee a plentifull proofe of our Sauiour Chriſt his perfect obedience, in glorifying the name of God, by his perfect preaching and publiſhing of it, according to his office and calling, and that alſo euen from the beginning to the end of the time thereof, verſ. 4.6.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we haue a teſtimonie of our iuſtification in Chriſt through his obedience, in the end of the 6. verſe, and verſes 11.12. where alſo we ſee how carefull he was ouer his Diſciples to keepe them in obedience to God, and that his name ſhould not be diſhonoured by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Our vnperfect obedience is for Chriſts ſake accepted of God.</note> our Sauiour Chriſt prayeth for the increaſe of our ſanctification and obedience, according to the will of God, and therein giueth to vnderſtand, that God accepteth the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:182:55"/> obedience of his ſeruants, though it be ſtill vnperfect.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo a teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt his glorifying of the name of God, and of our iuſtification in him, Hebrewes 2.9.10.11.12.</p>
            <p>Finally, what his generall care of glorifying the name of God, call to mind from his doctrine, Matth. 5.16. and verſes 33.34.35.36.37. Yea his whole doctrine is a moſt ample &amp; full declaration of it. Reade alſo Iohn chapter 7.15.16.17. and chapter 8.49.50.</p>
            <p>Nothing remaineth therefore, but that we placing our truſt and beliefe in the mercies of our God in the name of Chriſt, &amp; repenting of our ſinnes, do carefully and in godly maner labour to increaſe dayly in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, to the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his name, nothing doubting but that thus we ſhall be plentifully bleſſed of him, though not for the worthines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet for the honour of his owne name, and the praiſe of his rich mercies, to whome be all praiſe and honour for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
            <p>And thus come we to the fourth Commandement, the laſt of that great commandement of almightie God contayned in the firſt Table.</p>
            <p>Rehearſe the words of the fourth Commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy. Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all thy worke. But the ſeuenth day is a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to the Lord thy God: ſee that neither thou do anie worke therein, nor thy ſonne, &amp;c. For in ſixe dayes, &amp;c. Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fourth Commandement, concerning the ſpeciall time of Gods worſhip hath ſome neare affinitie with the ſecond, which commandeth a ſpeciall place to the ſame end, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſometimes in one common charge linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Leuit. 19.30. and chap. 26.3. Neuertheleſſe it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſpeciall practiſe of all the former commandements of this firſt table, and the ſeuerall duties thereof, both inward &amp; outward, priuate and publike, to the perfecting of the entire and whole practiſe of Gods worſhip. Yea it requireth alſo a ſpeciall practiſe of all duties of loue to our neigbour, both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in affection and meditation: and particular in action, as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:182:55"/> the occaſions ſhall require.<note place="margin">Diuers wayes diſtinguiſhed from euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> And finally it is both the ſchoole-time, and as it were the nurcerie of all godlineſſe and vertue, to be practiſed in the whole courſe of our liues; and alſo the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or fayer day of our ſoules, wherein the Lord doth in moſt plentifull manner open his ſtorehouſe, and as it were ſetteth out his moſt precious merchandize both victuall and Iewels, for the nouriſhing and beautifying of the ſoule, to be bought freely and without monie, of all that be deſirous to be fed and inriched by them, althogh they be able to bring nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be exchanged for them. Reade Iſa. 55.1.2.3. Ho, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, &amp;c. ye that haue no ſiluer, come buy and eate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing it is a commandement of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo beneficiall, and of ſo neceſſarie and manifold, yea of ſo vniuerſall good vſe: let vs continue our diligence without wearineſſe, to make our inquirie into the right vnderſtanding and vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all in ſo much as the Lord in the manner of the publiſhing of this Commandement, hath made it notable by diſtinguiſhing of it ſo, as it may diuers wayes be diſcerned from all the reſt of the Commandements:</p>
            <p>Shew therefore in the firſt place which thoſe differences and diſtinctions are?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt difference, whereby the Lord hath diſtinguiſhed this his fourth Commandement, not onely from all the Camman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of this firſt Table, but alſo from euerie Commandement of his whole Law, is that he doth not onely ſay; Thou ſhalt keepe holy the Sabbath day: but, Remember that thou keepe it holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond difference is, that he hath publiſhed and ſet it downe both affirmatiuely commaunding the good duties, and alſo negatiuely with an expreſſe prohibition and forbidding of the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ie euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third difference is, that he layeth an expreſſe charge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all thoſe that haue anie gouernement ouer others, either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate or publike, ciuill or eccleſiaſticall, that they do not onely remember and regard their owne dutie therein, but alſo that they looke to thoſe which be vnder their gouernement, that they together with them ſelues do ſanctifie and keepe holy the Lords
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:182:56"/> Sabbath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth difference is, that he vſeth more reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade vnto the obedience of it, then he ſetteth dovvne concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any other of his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All is true which you anſwere: and the differences which you mention are ſo plaine and euident, that we neede not vſe many words to ſhew it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore proceede. For what cauſes eſpecially hath the Lord by theſe notable differences diſtinguiſhed this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from all the reſt, in the diuerſe maner of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He commandeth vs firſt of all, to remember his Sabbath to keepe it holy, partly to point vs backe to this his firſt and moſt auncient inſtitution of it from the beginning of the vvorld, euen from the very next day after that mankind vvas created: and partly to admoniſh vs by all good and well aduiſed foreſight to prepare our ſelues, and to diſpoſe of all our ordinarie vvorkes &amp; buſineſſe, in ſo vviſe and diſcreet an order, as vvithout all vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie diſturbance and hinderance vve may ſanctifie and keepe holy the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thus obſerued, let vs now come to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and matter of the Commandement, proceeding in the ſame order which hath bene ſt downe in the beginning.</p>
            <p>And firſt touching the ſenſe and meaning of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, What are the good duties which the Lord requireth in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord doth generally commaund tvvo things in this holy Commaundement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that euery ſeuenth day all his people of euery eſtate &amp; condition, do reſt and ceaſe from all the ordinary labours and exerciſes of their bodies, and from all ſtudies and diſcourſes either in their ovvne mindes by themſelues, or one vvith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſpeech and communication concerning anie vvorldly (though in themſelues lavvfull and honeſt) affaires and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, vvith anie reſpect of vvorldly gaine or earthly pleaſure &amp; delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, and that alſo more principally God commaundeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:182:56"/> that all and euerie one of and amongſt his people, do vvith all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care and ioyfulneſſe of heart, vpon euerie ſuch day of holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths &amp; reſt, exerciſe themſelues both publikely in thoſe partes of the day vvhich are, and according to Gods Commaundement ought to be appointed to the publike duties of his worſhips; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo priuately all the reſt of the day, in and about the holy things of God, euen ſuch as do directly concerne his glorie and our ovvne ſpirituall edification and comfort in the way of eternall ſaluation. And in either of theſe reſpects, he layeth the ſpeciall-charge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe that haue gouernement ouer others, as was anſvvered before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, and we ſhall haue further occaſion hereafter to conſider of it more fully.</p>
            <p>Either part of this anſwer is lightſome enough from the words of the Commandement. The firſt in the 10. verſe, the ſecond in the 8. verſe.</p>
            <p>Now let vs go forward.</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe bodily labours, ſtudies and diſcourſes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the thoughts and meditations of our owne heartes alone, or in talke and communication with others, which the Lord commaundeth all to reſt and ceaſe vpon his Sabbath daies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euerie husbandman and manuall artificer, or other occupier and ſhopkeeper must ceaſe their vvorke, both in the field abrode, or in the barne, ſhop or vvarehouſe at home, for that day, yea euen in ſeed-time and harueſt muſt they ceaſe, or though anie vvorke-man vvere in Church-vvorke as vve vſe to ſpeake: All fayres, markets and marchandizing muſt ceaſe for that day. All aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes and Seſſions vvith their examinations, pleadings, and iudgements, all ſummoning and arreſting both in Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall Courts, and all their proceedings muſt ceaſe for that day. All Scriueners muſt ceaſe their drawing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their inſtruments and writings. All ſtudies and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of humane literature and learning in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſities, and all other ſcholles, whether for reading, writing, or diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt ceaſe for that day, and giue place to the higheſt and moſt neceſſarie ſtudie and learning: yea euen the ordinarie courſe of the ſtudies of Diuines muſt be ceaſſed, that the duties of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:182:57"/> Gods worſhip may be practiſed of them with the reſt of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Phiſition muſt ceaſe his vſuall ſtudying, preſcribing, and miniſtring of bodily Phiſicke to others, that he may ſeeke after the health of his owne ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The traueller muſt ceaſe his trauell, that he may learne the way to the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The victualler and tauerner of Inne and euerie other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling houſe, muſt ceaſe their ordinarie victualling, leaſt they famiſh their ovvne ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All muſtering and trayning of ſouldiers for voluntarie and offenſiue vvarres must ceaſe, that vve may learne to fight the Lords battels, againſt the world, the fleſh and the Diuell, which are the most capitall and deadly enemies that we haue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, euerie one muſt ceaſe the ordinarie courſe of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and labour of his vvorldly office and calling, that he be not either altogether withheld, or by anie meanes distracted in his mind from the the ſpirituall ſeruice and worſhip of God, when he is bodily preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of theſe things, read Exodus 34.21. Neh. 13.15. Exod. 31.1. &amp;c. and verſes 12.13. &amp;c. and chapt. 35.2.3. &amp;c. Nehem. ch. 10.31. &amp; chap. 13.16. and Ier. 17.21.22. Iohn 2.14. and Matth. 21.12.13.</p>
            <p>But it may be demaunded (for the remouing of all doubt) whether at no hand, nor vpon anie neceſsitie, it may not be lawfull to do ſome bodily workes vpon the Sabbath day, yea ſome of theſe workes which haue alreadie bene mentioned.</p>
            <p>What anſwere haue you learned to giue vnto this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All bodily labours, together vvith the thoughts, conſultations, and ſpeeches thereof, vvhich be of preſent neceſſitie, either to further the vvorſhip of God for our ovvne ſpirituall benefite, or our ſelues to it for the glorie of God, or elſe be preſently neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the bodily ſafetie, either of our neighbour, or our ſelues, or of anie thing of good and neceſſarie vſe, belonging vnto vs or them: they are all lavvfull on the Sabbath day, yea though it be (for the time of neceſſitie) vvith ceaſſing from the publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods vvorſhip, ſo as the mind and heart be diſpoſed as it ought to be, in the doing of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew further how you haue bene taught, that this ought to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:182:57"/> be, I meane how the heart and mind of man ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in ſuch caſes of preſent neceſſitie, which enforce vs to intermit the holy duties of Gods worſhip vpon the Lords day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ought to be ſorie for the occaſion, in reſpect of our hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the worſhip of God, which aboue all things we ought to long after and to deſire; but yet in reſpect of our neighbours neceſſitie, ought to be heartily glad, that we may be inſtruments of Gods prouidence for anie ſpeciall reliefe and benefite to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therewithall alſo we ought to haue care to make as ſpeedie expedition as the neceſſitie will permit, that we may ioyne vvith the Church of God in the most principall duties of his holy Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew theſe things yet further by ſome inſtances, that we may ſee more clearely how we are with good teſtimonie of our conſcience to behaue our ſelues in theſe caſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The occaſions are more particular, as thus: if our neighbour, for whoſe comfort our attendance or ſeruice is neceſſarie, be for the time of Gods publike vvorſhip verie ſore or daungerouſly ſicke, or if anie of his cattell, vvhoſe life I may preſerue, be in my knovvledge, vvithout my ſpeedie helpe in ſpeciall daunger of decay.</hi>

               <hi>There are alſo more generall and publike occaſions, as they may fall out, thus: if our neighbours houſe be on a fire: or if the enemie do vpon the Lords Sabbath make warre vpon our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: in ſuch caſes and the like, the Lord requireth mercie to our neighbour, and fidelitie and fortitude for the ſafetie of our Prince and countrie, according to the instant neceſſitie, and not ſacrifice, as the holy Scriptures teach vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: So we reade the teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt Matth. 12.11.12. And againe, Luke 6.9. Reade alſo chap. 13. verſes 14.15.16. And againe, chapter 14.5.6.</p>
            <p>And touching the like libertie in publike daungers, reade 2. Kings chap. 11. And againe, 2. Chron. 23. Reade alſo Nehem. 13.19. And 1. Maccab. 2.40.41. and chapter 9.43. &amp;c. we haue the practiſe of neceſſarie defence by warre.</p>
            <p>Now, which are thoſe holy things and buſineſſes, wherein and about the which we ſtand charged by Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:182:58"/> to ſpend the whole day of his Sabbath, as much as we may poſſibly attaine vnto, which he calleth the ſanctifying of the Sabbaths?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe holy buſineſſes and duties are, the religious frequenting of the holy aſſemblies of Gods people in the holy places thereunto appoynted, and in the holy times and ſeaſons thereof, that is, on the dayes of the holy Sabbath of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are alſo the excerciſing of our ſelues both publikely with the reſt of the congregation, and priuately apart by our ſelues, in all the holy duties and exerciſes of Gods holy worſhip, both inward and outward, mentioned before in the interpretation, both of the firſt, and alſo of the ſecond and third Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore, they are the trying of our ovvne heartes and liues, hovv vve proceede or go backevvard, or ſtand at a ſtay, in the loue and obedience of the true religion of God: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the remembrance and meditation of Gods mercie, chiefly of our redemption by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and of his iudgements, eyther vpon our ſelues or others, a ſtirring vp and quickening of our ovvne ſoules, either to thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ioy in the Lord, or to godly ſorrovv and repentance, vvith the increaſes thereof, in regard of our ovvne ſinnes, and faylings, as the matter it ſelfe, and as the ſeuerall occaſions ſhall require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, they are the ſpeciall exerciſes of mutuall brotherly kindneſſe and mercifull dealing, both tovvardes the bodies in outvvard reliefe, and alſo the ſoules of our brethren by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſuccour of inſtruction, conference, or prayer, to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of that grace and povver, vvherevvith the Lord ſhall make euerie one of vs able from time to time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwere truely; for notwithſtanding the inſtitution of theſe duties of Gods worſhip is ſet downe in the former Commaundement: yet the ſpeciall practiſe of them all is required in this fourth Commaundement, which aſſigneth and layeth foorth vnto vs the principall times and ſeaſons ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſanctified of God to the ſame end.</p>
            <p>But are theſe holy duties ſo tyed and appropriated to the Lords holy Sabbaths, and on the other ſide, are we ſo bound
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:182:58"/> to vnceſſant labour in the ordinarie duties of our worldly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for the whole ſpace of the ſixe dayes of the weeke,<note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Libertie of Sabbath. Sixe dayes labour.</note> that we be exempt and diſcharged from all holy dutie of Gods worſhip vpon thoſe dayes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may not vnderſtand the Commaundement ſo: for as it is lavvfull for a man to do ſuch bodily vvorkes and labours as be neceſſarie, euen on the Sabbath day, in ſuch maner as hath bene alreadie anſvvered: ſo, yea much rather, is it lavvfull, yea euen the bounden dutie of all the ſeruants of God, vpon euerie one of the ſixe dayes in the vveeke, to ſpend ſo much time in the holy and ſpirituall duties of Gods vvorſhip, as he ſhall find neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to keepe his heart vvith God, and by prayer morning and euening to commend himſelfe and all his affaires, and the vvhole Church of God, to the continuall protection and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further alſo it is lawfull, yea the bounden dutie of euerie one, not hindred by ſome neceſſarie let, to ceaſe his ordinarie vvorke or honeſt recreation or delight, to heare the ſermon, if there be anie on the vveeke day; yea to ſpend the vvhole day, vvhen it is commaunded either for the publike faſt, or for a publike thankeſgiuing, and holy feaſt to the ſpeciall honour of God, according to the ſpeciall occaſion, which he himſelfe ſhall giue thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of the good duties commaunded, whereunto alſo belongeth that ſpeciall point of the gouernours dutie mentioned in the beginning of our interpretation: but becauſe the occaſion of this conſideration is expreſly giuen in the negatiue part of the Commaundement, whereunto we are now to proceede, let vs conſider of it there.</p>
            <p>In which words therefore is this negatiue part contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In theſe: Neither thou ſhalt do anie vvorke, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man ſeruant, nor thy mayde, nor thy beaſt, nor the ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words, let vs conſider, firſt what is generally forbidden in this Commaundement, and then more ſpecially, what is the charge of all gouernours.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:182:59"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sinnes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>I demaund therefore in the firſt place, what are the euill things forbidden in this Commaundement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, all thoſe bodily labours belonging to this life, which (not being neceſſarie) would by our intermedling with them, either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together withhold, or at the leaſt hinder vs in the ſpirituall ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbath: yea he forbiddeth all worldlineſſe of mind, yea all negligence and improuidence, in not preuenting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſuch hinderance, ſo farre as we may by anie good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection foreſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much more doth the Lord forbid all vaine games and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, yea ſuch moderate exerciſes of bodily recreation, or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſporting and delighting of the mind, which at ſome other times he will tollerate and beare withall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Most of all doth the Lord forbid all practiſe of idolatrie and falſe worſhip vpon his Sabbath, together with the inſtitution of any other holyday or Sabbath by mans deuice, and al that exceſſe, wantonneſſe and riot, which vſually accompanieth the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, he forbiddeth all vnfruitfulneſſe in the exerciſes of his owne true ſeruice and worſhip: that is, when we profite not thereby in knowledge, faith, and repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the ſpeciall charge, which the Lord layeth vpon thoſe that haue gouernement ouer others, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſanctification of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, ſeeing the Lord layeth this ſpeciall charge vpon all gouernours, aſwell publike ouer common wealths &amp; churches, as priuate ouer families.</p>
            <p>Why doth he direct his ſpeech, and the forme of his charge more expreſly to fathers and maiſters of the priuate family, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe hovvſoeuer the eſtabliſhment, perfection, and glorie of holy and religious gouernement is in the hand of the publike gouernour, yet the ground and foundation of it, reſteth in the wel ordering of the family, vvhich alſo in the order of nature it ſelfe is before the gouernement, either of the Towne, Citie, or Countrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeede is euident from the order of Gods creation, and from the courſe of his proceeding, in rearing vp a Church vnto himſelfe from the beginning.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:182:59"/>
            <p>As the priuate family is in order of nature before the towne or citie,<note place="margin">Speciall duty of Gouernours.</note> ſo particular perſons haue bene conuerted and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, before cities, countries, and nations. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſo ſoone as Kingdomes were gathered to the Lord, he gaue the principall charge to the King, for the generall ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Sabbath, Reade Ieremie chapter 17.20. Read alſo Iſa. 49.22. and Pſalme 102.13. &amp;c. 18.21.</p>
            <p>Now let vs conſider the excellent reaſon of this the Lords moſt graue and weightie charge.</p>
            <p>And firſt, why doth he beginne with the maiſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that he may know, (whoſoeuer he be, whether maiſter of a greater or leſſer family) that he muſt giue an account of his gouernement to God, of vvhome he hath receiued it, vvho is the great Maiſter and commaunder both in heauen and in earth; vvho alſo vvill ſtreightly inquire, not onely hovv ciuill and iust, but much rather hovv holy and religious his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath bene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that he may vnderſtand, that the Lord requireth, that he do not onely commaund his ſonnes and his houſhold, but alſo that he go before them in his ovvne practiſe and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe if he were not brought to conſcience of his ovvne dutie firſt, he might by the abuſe of his authoritie, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate all the holy care vvhich might happily be begunne in his children and ſeruants, by vrging them to do othervviſe then the Law of God and their conſciences vvould permit them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that both ſeruants, and children, and ſtraungers, vnderſtanding hovv ſtreight a charge the Lord giueth to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours herein, they might be induced the more vvillingly to yeeld to this his holy appoyntment, or othervviſe that they might knovv, that they are no vvayes iniured, though they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their vvils, euen by ciuill or domeſticall correction, be constrained and compelled thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons indeede; and they are verie worthie in either reſpect to be diligently obſerued both of gouernors, and alſo of thoſe that are to be gouerned, euen as we would looke for anie comfort before the Lord, at the great day of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:182:60"/> his dreadfull iudgement. For when God will bring euerie worke vnto iudgement, with euerie ſecret thing, whether good or euill, Eccleſ. 12.14. how can we thinke that anie ſhall eſcape, who ſhall neglect the gouernement of thoſe that belong to their charge?</p>
            <p>But here ſome will likely demaund, why in this charge for the religious ordering of the family, there is no mention made of the wife, as though ſhe had no part in this gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>What may be the reaſon hereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is eaſily preſuppoſed of all, that according to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the husband and the vvife must be one, and vvithout all iarre mutuall helpers, ſpecially for the furtherance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of religion in their owne hearts, and among all that belong vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: they ought to rule with ioynt authoritie, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is the wiues part ſo to rule, as it may appeare that ſhe is willingly ſubiect to her husband. And chiefely her helpe is to be yeelded for the gouernement of her daughters and maid-ſeruants: according to the example of Queene Eſther, chapter 4.16. Reade alſo Prouerbes 31.15.27. and 1. Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie 5.14. and Ieremie 9.20. Reade alſo how the Lord will haue the mother or dame and miſtreſſe reſpected in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Leuiticus, chapter 19.3. and Deuteronomy 21.18. &amp;c. and Geneſis chapter 16.5.6.7.8.9. and chapter 20.9.10.11.12. It is time that we come to conſider of thoſe that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gouernement in the familie.</p>
            <p>Why are parents ſo ſpecially charged with their children for their ſanctification of the Sabbath: that is to ſay, as touching ſo manie of them as be of vnderſtanding?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To admoniſh them of that, vvherein they ought chiefly to manifeſt and exerciſe their right godly and parent-like affection toward them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This verily doth conſiſt chiefly in their loue and deſire of the ſanctification of their ſoules, and by that care which they haue in the vſing of the meanes which ſerue thereunto: that is, ſo farre as they be carefull to bring them to the loue and liking of the word and worſhip of God, and to trayne them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:182:60"/> vp in the religious ſanctification of the Lords holy Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>We come to the ſeruants: Why are they alſo expreſſely mentioned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſhew that maiſters of families ought in a ſecond degree to extend their parent-like affection, euen toward their ſeruants alſo, in a tender care and deſire of their euerlaſting ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very true: for not withſtanding they are ſeruants to their maiſters, yet they are children ſtill in reſpect of their owne parents; yea they are the children of God and of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vnder his couenant of grace, mercie, and peace, which comprehendeth both parent, and child, and maiſter, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. Neither is there anie reſpect of perſon with God. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therefore ought in theſe reſpects to haue a fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction toward them, as vnto children in a ſecond degree. Reade Leuiticus 25.42.43.55.</p>
            <p>Why is the brute beaſt mentioned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not onely to the end that the cattell ordinarily vſed to dayly labour (ſuch as are the oxen or the horſe, to plow and to cart) might haue intermiſſion and reſt, and ſo haue a kind of mercie or pitie ſhewed them: but chiefly that no man ſhould preſume to breake the outward reſt of the Sabbath, and take libertie to neglect the publike ſanctification of it, vnder pretence that he (to ſerue his owne pleaſure) taketh his pampered beaſt, either his Coach horſe, or gelding for the ſaddle, to ride his iourney without any labour to himſelfe; yea though he taketh his Bible and prayer booke with him to reade as he ſitteth in his Coach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: and if this prouiſo had not bene made, many would haue made their cunning euaſions to deceiue their owne ſoules thereby. One would haue ſaid, I can grind in my horſe-mill without any labour. So alſo would the water-miller and wind-miller ſay, &amp;c. But all ſuch ſhifts are taken away, vnleſſe in caſe of neceſſitie, as hath bene anſwered before. So then, that which the Lord commaundeth concerning the reſt of the brute beaſtes, both here, and Exodus 23.12. it doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſerue to reſtraine men. Reade Deuteronomy 25.14. with 1. Corinth. 9.9 10.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt place, why is the ſtrannger mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:182:61"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Equitie.</note>
               <hi>Partly, becauſe ſuch ſtrangers as vvere of the ſame religion with the Iewes: that is to ſay, circumciſed Proſelites, they were equally bound by the ſame law of ſanctifying the Sabbath, like as ſhould be all baptiſed Iewes or Turkes, if anie vvere liuing amongſt Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as touching other ſtrangers, ſuch as come on ambaſſage to Princes, or according to their ovvne priuate minds to ſee countries, &amp;c. they must be cauſed at the least to obſerue the bodily rest, that the offence and daunger of ſo euill an example might be auoyded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is verie meete indeede that it ſhould be ſo, in ſomuch as we are ouer readie to take hurt by euerie euill example of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and licence, whenſoeuer it commeth in the view and ſight of our eye. And therefore alſo ſaith the Lord: One law ſhall be to him that is borne in the Land, and to the ſtraunger which dwelleth among you, Exodus 12, 49.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the interpretation what things are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and what are forbidden in this fourth Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
            <p>Now what is the equitie of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much euerie way, as the due conſideration of the ſundrie reaſons annexed to the Commandement will declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew which thoſe reaſons are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is, that the Lord hath left vs the free libertie of ſixe dayes, for the honeſt and lawfull buſineſſe and affaires of this life, vnto one weekely Sabbath ſet apart for his ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is, the example of the Lord in his owne ceaſſing vpon that day from the workes of creation, vvhich he finiſhed and perfected in the ſixe dayes going immediatly before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third is, the inſtitution, bleſſing, and ſanctifying of the Sabbath, which is as auncient, as is the example of the Lord in that his holy reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth reaſon is, the ends vvhereunto the Lord did ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his Sabbath, that is to ſay, for the memoriall of the Lords vvorkes of creation, to his honour and glorie, and for our ovvne ſanctification and ſaluation, through the bleſſed vſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof.</hi>

               <hi>And they ſhall come from the Cities of Iudah, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ieruſalem, and from the land of Beniamine, and from the plaine, and from the mountaine, and from the South, vvhich ſhall bring burnt offerings, and ſacrifices, and meate offerings, and incenſe: and they ſhall bring ſacrifice of prayſe into the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt gracious bleſſings of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. But becauſe the promiſes are not duly regarded of vs, let vs come to the curſes wherewith the Lord hath armed this Commandement againſt the tranſgreſſors of it. Theſe curſes are likewiſe of all ſorts, in ſo much as God eſteemeth the prophaning of his Sabbaths, to be the prophaning of his whole religion.</p>
            <p>But let vs call to minde thoſe onely which are moſt expreſly mentioned: and firſt what was the curſe of God in the ciuill courſe of his iuſtice among his people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It vvas bodily death. He that defileth the Sabbath ſhall dye the death: Whoſoeuer worketh therein, the ſame perſon ſhall be cut off from among his people. And againe: Whoſoeuer dath any worke in the Sabbath day, ſhall dye the death, Exod. chap.</hi> 31.14.15.16.</p>
            <p>Of this part of Gods iuſtice, the Magiſtrate was his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There are other curſes which God threateneth to bring vpon the breakers of his Sabbath, more immediatly from his owne hand:</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 17. <hi>Chapter of Ieremie, verſe</hi> 27. <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord: If ye vvill not heare me, to ſanctifie the Sabbath day, and not to beare a burthen, nor to go through the gates of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem on the Sabbath day: then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall deuour the pallaces of Ieruſalem, and it ſhall not be quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A grieuous iudgement of God: and that which may point vs to the cauſe of the often burnings that we heare off, and ſee among our ſelues, euen becauſe the Sabbaths of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:182:62"/> Lord are ſo greatly profaned, &amp;c.<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But let vs go forward.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt thoſe who notwithſtanding they will peraduenture do no bodily worke, or make their market on the Sabbath day, yet their hearts runne after their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit and gaine, neither regard they to exerciſe mercy, but rather deale hardly againſt their poore brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heare this (ſayth the Prophet Amos, chapter</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>O ye that ſwallovv vp the poore, that ye may make the needy of the land to faile:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saying, vvhen vvill the nevv Moone be gone, that vve may ſell corne, and the Sabbath, that vve may ſell foorth vvheate, and make the Epha ſmall, and the ſhekell great, and falſifie the weights by deceipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we may buy the poore with ſiluer, and the needy for a paire of ſhoes (that is) for a matter of ſmall price, for litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as we ſay) yea, and ſell the refuſe of vvheate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hath ſworne by the excellency of Iaacob (that is to ſay by himſelfe) ſurely I will neuer forget any of his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall not the land tremble for this, and euery one mourne that dwelleth therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This iudgement alſo is very grieuous and fearefull, as the Prophet ſtill proſecuteth it to the end of the Chapter, ſhewing that theſe euill fruites ariſe from the contempt of the word and the preaching thereof, which is as it were the life of the Sabbath. Reade alſo Nehem. chap. 13.17.18. The prophaning of the Sabbath is the ruine both of the Church and common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the doctrine of this Commandement.</p>
            <p>The vſe is yet behind: haue you perfectly obeyed it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, but I beſeech God of his infinite mercy to forgiue me my manyfold and grieuous tranſgreſſions againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercie pardon and forgiue vs all: for as often as we examine our ſelues, we ſhall euerie one find, that we both are and haue beene grieuous tranſgreſſors of it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now therefore ſeeing our onely ſuccour againſt our owne ſinnes, and againſt the curſes thereof, together with all our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:182:63"/> hope of bleſſing reſteth in our Sauiour Chriſt alone:<note place="margin">Christ onely hath perfectly obeyed.</note> it ſhall be greatly for the comfort and confirmation of our faith, to ſee ſome proofe and confirmation out of the word of God, that he hath perfectly obeyed this Law of God for vs.</p>
            <p>What proofe can you alledge for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole hiſtory of his Goſpell doth manifeſtly and verie plentifully confirme it, vnder the vndoubted teſtimony of all the Euangeliſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew how that is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is euident, not onely that they do all (and ſpecially Marke and Luke) diligently ſet downe and record in holy vvrit his moſt holy and conſtant labour, in the preaching of the Goſpell vpon the Sabbath dayes, for the inſtructing of the ſoules of men in the right way of their ſaluation; and therewithall likewiſe how vpon the ſame dayes he exerciſed his ſpirituall workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, towards the bodies of all ſorts of impotent and diſeaſed men, yea, towards both bodies and ſoules, of ſuch as were wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and vexed by Diuels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But alſo it is euident by that more particular teſtimony of the Euangeliſt Luke, concerning his moſt holy care, euen from his childhood, to reſort to the places of Gods vvorſhip in the ſpeciall times thereof, to vvorſhip God, and to heare and inquire of the doctrine of his word, at the mouthes of thoſe which were the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and teachers thereof, as we reade</hi> 2. <hi>Luke from the</hi> 42. <hi>verſe to the end of the Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeed we reade there, that when he was twelue yeares old he went vp to Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But much more when he came to mans age, and that he was to manifeſt himſelfe to Iſrael, &amp;c. It is plentifully teſtified that he moſt carefully and perfectly ſanctified the Sabbath dayes.</p>
            <p>By him therefore are we redeemed from the curſe of this Law, and iuſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>By him alſo, if we beleeue in his name, and repent of our ſinnes, indeuoring more and more after the true ſanctifying of the Sabbath, the Lord will accept our obedience, though it be vnperfect, yea, and he will for Chriſts ſake intereſſe vs in all thoſe promiſes which he hath made to all ſuch as will haue
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:182:63"/> care to ſanctifie them as they ought to do,<note place="margin">The perpetuity of the Sabbath.</note> though they cannot fully attaine thereunto here in this life.</p>
            <p>But what particular ground or proofe of Scripture may we haue for this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euen the ſame which vvas alledged before out of the</hi> 9. <hi>chap. of Iohn, the</hi> 31. <hi>verſe: that God vvill heare euery man that is not a ſinner, but is a vvorſhipper of God, and indeuoureth to do his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This one place may well ſerue to either purpoſe, &amp;c. And thus might we ende the whole doctrine and vſe of this fourth Commandement, ſaue that the vnaduiſed contradiction of ſome doth occaſion a further buſineſſe, as though the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that is, the ſanctifying of euery ſeauenth day, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meere Iewiſh ceremony.</p>
            <p>But we will vſe as quicke ſpeed as may be in the rehearſall of this point.</p>
            <p>What is the ſumme of that which hath bene ſaid, and which ought to be firmely held of vs againſt that opinion &amp; aſſertion which is againſt the Sabbath?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue learned, that the Sabbath cannot be truly ſayd to haue bene at any time a meere ceremony; but that it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bene, and ſo is ſtill a morall and vnremoueable Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue learned alſo, that neither our Sauiour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe nor hic Apoſtles, haue abrogated, nor euer minded to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Lords Commandement touching the Sabbath, but they haue firmely confirmed and eſtabliſhed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What proofe haue you that our Sauiour Chriſt neuer min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abrogate the Sabbath: ſeeing that it may ſeeme that he both taught and practiſed a greater libertie then the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He himſelfe ſpeaking of the vvhole morall Law, and of the doctrine of the Prophets, who were the true and faithfull inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters thereof, ſaith profeſſedly, that he came not to deſtroy it, or any part of it, but wholly to fulfill it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore alſo it muſt be, that all is miſconſtrued, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may be imagined, either of the contrary doctrine or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of our Sauiour Chriſt, against the Commandement of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:182:64"/> Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: ſo our Sauior Chriſt ſayth, Matth. 5.17. Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets. I am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfill them. And there is no boubt but as he came not to deſtroy, looſen, or diſauthoriſe, the firſt, ſecond, or third Commandement: ſo neither hath he deſtroyed, or diſauthoriſed the fourth. But contrariwiſe, like as he hath eſtabliſhed the reſt of the ten Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo alſo hath he ratified and eſtabliſhed this. Onely he cleareth the right vſe and interpretation of them all againſt the falſe gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſies.</p>
            <p>But what proofe haue you that our Sauiour Chriſt did not abrogate and take away the Sabbath, ſeeing (as ſome alledge) they both taught and practiſed greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie then the Law of the Sabbath permitteth, yea, and leaue that day altogether: What canne you ſay to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſo much as the holy Apoſtles did onely alter and change the day, and that alſo to the verie next day: that is to ſay, ſeeing they onely tranſlated it from the ſeauenth day, vvhich was the very next after the vvorkes of Gods creation vvere ended, to the firſt day of the vveeke, vpon the vvhich the vvorld began, and vpon the vvhich the Sonne of God, by vvhom the vvorld vvas at the firſt made and all things therein, roſe againe by the mighty power of God, to declare himſelfe to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect redeemer of the people of God, and the onely meanes of the vpholding and preſeruing of the vvhole frame of this tranſitory and decayed world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further alſo, ſeeing they both by doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, imployed that firſt day of the vveeke in the vveekely recourſe of it, to the religious aſſembling of Gods people, and for the holy exerciſes of the Chriſtian duties of Gods vvorſhip; euen the ſame which haue been rehearſed before for the duties of the Lords Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, ſeeing the ſame firſt day of the vveeke, hath the name of the Lords day tranſlated vnto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is by all theſe reaſons manifeſt, that it vvas not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to abrogate and aboliſh the Sabbath of the Lord, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:182:64"/> is to ſay, the ſanctifying of euery ſeauenth day, but rather to eſtabliſh it vvith this ſo neare a change, to the perpetuall memoriall, not onely of the first creation, but alſo of this latter renewing of all things by our Sauiour Chriſt: to the more cleare and full honour of God, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, in theſe laſt dayes of the cleare reuelation of the Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons may ſuffice to euerie one that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious: for ſeeing the holy Apoſtles were moſt faithfull in all the houſe of God, as was Moſes; how may we with any reaſon once call it into queſtion, as doubting whether they had their commaundement and direction from our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe after his reſurrection, or no? And that the Apoſtles did onely chaunge the day, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely take away the Sabbath, reade Acts 20.7. and 1. Corinthians 16.1.2. and Reuelation 1.10. for they ſpent the firſt day of the weeke in the ſame holy exerciſes with Chriſtian Gentiles, wherein they ſpent the ſeauenth day with the Chriſtian Iewes, &amp;c. But that we may draw to an ende.</p>
            <p>How can you ſhew that the Sabbath is not a meere va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ceremony, now ſince the appearance of Chriſt and the cleare reuelation of his Goſpell?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe there ſhould not then be ten, but onely nine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of perpetuall durance in the morall Lavv of God: and alſo becauſe this Commandement vvas ordayned for man before yet there vvas any vſe of any figuratiue ceremony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto therefore of the firſt Table of the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeuerall branches of that which our Sauiour Chriſt calleth the great Commandement; the ſumme whereof he ſheweth to be the perfect loue of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Table followeth, which our Sauiour Chriſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe calleth the ſecond Commandement, &amp; ſaith that it is like to the former.</p>
            <p>Wherein haue you learned that they are like?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is like vnto the firſt in many reſpectes, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:182:65"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table is like vnto the firſt, and how it differeth from it.</note>
               <hi>Firſt, in that it is giuen by the ſame heauenly Law-giuer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in that it requireth perfect obedience in all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, in that it hath like promiſes of perfect reward to the perfect obedience of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, in that it hath like curſes, not only temporall, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall alſo, againſt euery tranſgreſſion of the vnbeleeuer, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, it is of like force and vertue with the firſt Table, to make knowne our ſinne and miſery, yea, not only to make knowne our failings in dutie to men, but therewithall alſo detecteth our hypocriſie againſt God, in our vnfruitfull profeſſion of his name and religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, it doth in like maner ſhew vs the neceſſity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſts perfect ſufferings and obedience, for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iuſtification, and ſaluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This manifold ſimilitude and likeneſſe of the ſecond Table with the firſt is partly cleare in it ſelfe, and will further be more manifeſt in the particular handling of the Commaundements thereof. But is there no difference of them like worthy of our obſeruation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes very worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew wherein this difference is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Table differeth from the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in the ſubiect, matter, and argument of it, which is the perfect loue of our neighbour: but the argument of the first Table (as hath bene declared before) is the perfect loue of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, there is difference in the maner or meaſure of that loue wherewith one neighbour is to loue another, which is not without limitation, as is the loue of man toward God: for it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Lord, and for his ſake, according to that naturall, kindly and well ordered loue and affection, which euery man may and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ought in the Lord and ſo as may be moſt for his glory, to beare toward his owne ſelfe, and not otherwiſe.</hi>

            <p>Let vs therefore come to the fift Commandement, which is the firſt of this ſecond Table: which is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy dayes may be</hi>

            <p>But why are all other degrees both of ciuill office, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall age, and ſpirituall gifts, &amp;c. thus comprehended vnder the titles of naturall parents?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe they are by the lavv and courſe of nature the firſt and moſt auncient degree of honour among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe the louing and tender gouernement of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parents, is the principall patterne and example whereunto all other gouernement is to be framed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe child-like ſubiection is the entrance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to all obedience and ſubiection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that it might the more clearely appeare, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God the ſubiection of euery inferiour is to his ſuperiour, of what degree ſoeuer he be: and on the contrary, how grieuous a ſinne diſobedience to any ſuperiour is, in ſo much as it is of like nature with the vndutifulneſſe of a child againſt his naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or againſt his mother that bare him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto, who are meant by the honourable titles of father and mother.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to ſee what that honour is which God commandeth vs to yeeld vnto them: the which, becauſe we cannot better vnderſtand then by ſearching out what thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall duties are which God in his word expreſſeth, as belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to euery one, either in common or more ſpecially, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſeuerall degree and calling, let vs follow this courſe. And firſt what is the honour which children are commanded to yeeld vnto their naturall parents?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord commanding vs to honour our naturall parents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that we do all the dayes of our liues reuerendly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:182:66"/> of them and of their holy prayers and bleſſing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: and firſt to naturall parents.</note> 
               <hi>and of their vviſe inſtructions and counſels, both for the courſe and trade of life vvhich we are to take, and for the company which vve are to make choyſe of, and eſpecially then vvhen vve ſhall come to thinke of ſeeking a companion to liue vvith vs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that as a fruite of that reuerend eſtimation, we do not onely in outward gesture and ſpeech behaue our ſelues duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully toward them, but alſo that we obey them from the heart, ſubmitting our ſelues to their godly gouernement and diſcipline, and that euery vvay we ſeeke to vvin them to pray for vs, and to bleſſe vs, and to giue all good occaſion to ioy in vs, and to bleſſe and prayſe God for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that we ſhevv our ſelues thankefull, in all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to recompence their goodneſſe toward vs to the vttermost of our power, wherein ſoeuer they ſhall at any time ſtand in neede of our helpe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, ſeeing we cannot recompence them, or at the moſt but in part, we are to pray continually vnto God, ſo long as they liue, that it may pleaſe him on our behalfe, fully and for euer to recompence and reward them. Yea, and all theſe duties are to be performed from hearty loue and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the honour that children owe to their naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, beſide ſeemely buriall, if we ſuruiue them, and dutifull ſpeech and memoriall of them, &amp;c. But why are all theſe duties comprehended vnder this word, Honor, rather then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der loue?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To put a difference betweene that loue we owe to our inferiors or equals, which is more familiar, and this loue wherein we ſtand bound to our parents and all other our ſuperiours, which may not be ſeuered from feare and reuerence.</hi>

            <p>Now, what is the honour that ſubiects owe to their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne kings, and to all other their inferiour Magiſtrates?</p>

            <p>Thus then we ſee in the whole diſcourſe how all degrees of ſuperiours are (according to the commandement of God) to be honoured of their inferiours, whether they be ſuch as be ſo in reſpect of the order which God hath ſet in nature, or in pollicy. To the which alſo we cannot but adde that order which he hath ſet in aunciencie of ſpirituall gifts and graces, according as we ſee the Apoſtle Paule to giue it the note of honour. Reade Romans 16.1.2.3.4.5.6.7. &amp;c. and 1. Cor. 16.15.16.</p>
            <p>Now brethren I beſeech yee be obedient to ſuch.</p>
            <p>And Paule himſelfe prayeth for ſuch, 2. Timothie. 1.16.17.18.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore the manifold bond whereby we ſtand bound to giue honour vnto other, in humbling of our ſelues, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But not onely are inferiours to honour their ſuperiours: but ſuperiours alſo muſt know, that God requireth of them, that they do yeeld a certaine honour to their inferiours, and deale honourably and well with them, according to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their ſeuerall places and degrees.</p>
            <p>For there is no doubt, but the Lord requireth them at their hands, as hath bene partly declared in the interpretation of the fourth Commaundement: wherefore it is to good purpoſe, that in this place we do lay them forth in a more full diſcourſe, as followeth.</p>
            <p>To ſpeake generally, they are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, faithfulneſſe in gouerning, according to true iuſtice and iudgement, in the feare of God, who is the iudge of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours and gouernours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, loue toward the people of God, with a parent-like affection.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, grauitie and conſtancie both in word and deed, as may beſt beſeeme the credit of that place and office which euerie one beareth.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, modeſt and humble behauiour both in word and geſture: yet ſo againe, as may beſt beſeeme the honour of the perſon which any ſuſtaineth, and as may likewiſe ſtand with that holy courage and ſeueritie which his office requireth.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, a mercifull tollerating or bearing with infirmities, by moderating the ſtrict rigour of ciuill lawes and penalties v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon reaſonable conſiderations, ſo farre as may ſtand with a currant and inoffenſiue courſe of iuſtice.

            <p>The duties of the Captaine in warre, are, to tender the life of his ſouldiers, ſo as he do not hazard them in needleſſe or deſperate attempts: that he yeeld them their iuſt and ordinarie pay: that he be of good courage &amp; comfort to them in time of neceſſarie daunger: finally, that he make them partakers in the ſpoile of the victorie, Geneſis 14.24. 1.

            <p>Theſe are the duties of ſuperiours toward their inferiours.</p>
            <p>But what if they do not their duties as they ought, but deale diſhonourably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. are inferiours then diſcharged of dutie, ſo that we ſtand not thenceforth bound to honour our parents &amp; Princes, &amp;c. according to their ſeuerall places and degrees of honour, which God hath beſtowed vpon them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albeit (if they be very wicked ſpecially againſt the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of God) we cannot euery way and ſo fully honour them, as if they did performe the duties of their places to the honour and glorie of God: neither indeede are they worthie of it: yet for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:182:71"/> Lords ſake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How honour &amp; worſhip due to men, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from that which is due to God.</note> 
               <hi>and in dutifull regard of his commaundements and ordinances (in ſo much as all the powers that be, are ordained of God) we ſtand bound ſo farre to honour them, as we do not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him: to obey and bow to them, ſo far as vve do not diſobey and lift vp our ſelues againſt him. Yea euen in all things are we to ſubmit our ſelues to them, ſo as in nothing we rebell againſt him: we muſt be thankefull to them, ſo farre as we ſhew not our ſelues vnthankefull to him. And aboue all things, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pray earnestly to God for the moſt wicked of them, that it might pleaſe him of his infinit mercie to turn their harts, and to giue them grace to do their duties faithfully, that ſo they may haue more worthie honour, both before God and men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as touching all humane infirmities of thoſe that be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe both good and godly, it is the dutie of euerie one pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to beare with them, yea as much as we may, to couer and hide them, that they breake not forth to their diſhonour, eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelues, or in the ſight or hearing of anie other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, as we are inſtructed from the example of Sem and Iapheth, Gen. 9.23.</p>
            <p>And further touching wicked Kings and Princes, that it is our duties to pray for them, we learne from the Apoſtles, who ſo charged Chriſtians to do, while yet they were enemies to the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, if they commaund vs any thing contrarie to the word of God, we muſt obey God rather then man. For in that reſpect, we haue no father, king, or maiſter, &amp;c. but God alone, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here might we come to the negatiue part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but for the remouing of a certaine ſcruple. I pray therefore, let vs ſtay our courſe awhile, ſeeing it giueth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a very good and neceſſarie inſtruction.</p>
            <p>In ſo much as all honour belongeth vnto God, and we are commaunded to worſhip him alone, Matth. 4.10. 1. Tim. 6.15.16. &amp;c. yea in this reſpect Peter reproueth Cornelius for bowing downe very low, to declare his honourable and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend eſtimation of him, Acts 10.26.</p>
            <p>And Reuel. chap. 19.10. and againe chap. 22.8.9. euen the Angell of Chriſt reproueth Iohn twiſe, for bowing downe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:182:71"/> low to giue honour vnto him, and biddeth him worſhip God:<note place="margin">How honour and worſhip due to God, differeth from honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> And Iob 32.21.22.

            <p>How therefore may we account anie men honourable and worſhipfull, &amp; accordingly yeeld them the outward geſtures and titles of honour and worſhip; and yet not defraud God of that which is proper and due vnto him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the clearing of this point, we muſt neceſſarily put a great difference betwixt diuine honour and worſhip, which is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God: and ciuill honour and worſhip, which God himſelfe permitteth, yea commaundeth to be yeelded of man vnto a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew what that difference is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We honour and vvorſhip God immediatly for his owne ſake, that is to ſay, we bow the knees both of our bodies and alſo of our ſoules before him, and we are moſt humble and hearty ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vnto him, in all things according to his will, with ſure truſt and confidence in his mercie, and with an acknowledgement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the bottome of our hearts, that he onely is of moſt high and excellent maieſtie, aboue all ſuperioritie and degree either of earthly Prince or heauenly Angell, and ſo conſequently, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him worthy more reuerend honour and vvorſhip, then can poſſibly be yeelded to him of our ſelues, or of anie of all his creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But all the honour and worſhip vvhich vve giue vnto men, vve yeeld it onely in and for the Lord; that is to ſay, although vve bow not onely the knees of our bodies, but alſo the affections of our mindes and ſpirits before them as in the ſight of God: and though as our neceſſities &amp; duties require, we do ſomtimes make our humble ſutes &amp; ſupplications to them: neuertheles we know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as our honor &amp; worſhip toward God is alwaies too ſhort and fayling, ſo this vnto men may be exceſſiue &amp; too much: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve alwaies retayne and hold this perſwaſion in our hearts, that euen our highest ſuperiours here vpon earth, are but the inſtruments of Gods goodneſſe toward vs from heauen, though indeed they be his very honourable instruments, &amp; that all their power is limited according to the good pleaſure of his diuine vvill. Neither do vve yeeld vnto them, or aske of them, or feare and expect from them any thing, which God hath reſerued as proper and entire vnto himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:182:72"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sinnes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>This is a true difference indeed: and if you ſhall expreſſe this laſt point by ſome particulars, you ſhall make the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much more plaine.</p>
            <p>Rehearſe therefore ſome of thoſe things which God hath reſerued wholly to himſelfe, and are onely to be ſought and expected from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We do not ſeeke to anie earthly Superiour or Power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parent or Prince or anie other, for the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, nor for the inheritance of his heauenly kingdome: no neither do we ſeeke to them for health and preſeruation in time of plague and ſickeneſſe, nor for fruitfull ſeaſons and plentie in the time of dearth and famine, &amp;c. but to God onely, as the author and giuer of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If they wrong vs, God is righteous and will do vs iuſtice; though they ſhold kill our bodies, yet God will ſaue our ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of the affirmatiue part of this fift Com. of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, the God of all diuine honour, worſhip and glorie.</p>
            <p>Now on the contrarie, what are the euils and tranſgreſſions which the Lord forbiddeth in it? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hauing in this Commandement eſtabliſhed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of degrees of honour, both in nature, and alſo for godly pollicie and communion of life: and hauing likewiſe commaunded all inferiours to yeeld to euerie one of their ſuperiours their due honour: and that all ſuperiours alſo ſhould ſo liue and gouerne, as they may be worthie honour, it is hereupon plainely to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the Lord forbiddeth on the one hand all anarchie or want of gouernement, and diſordered confuſion, together with all tyrannous, ouerstately, proud, and rigorous Lordlineſſe and dominion, yea euerie vnkind and vnparent-like abuſe thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And on the other hand, he forbiddeth all ſtubborne contempt and diſobedience, vvith all enuious and ambitious conſpiracie and rebellion: yea all fayling in the faithfull performance of any good ſeruice and dutie, either in vvill, vvord, or deede, in euerie one not anſwering to that place of inferioritie and ſubiection wherein the Lord hath ſet him.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The generall equitie of it, is:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe as the diſtinction and difference of degree it ſelf, ſo alſo all the degrees of the ſame diſtinction according as they haue bene mentioned before, they are the honourable ordinance and appointment of God.</hi>

               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe God hath ſet them ouer vs, to prouide for vs, to guide and direct, to rule and to gouerne vs, as in his owne ſteade.</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly, becauſe of the many and great benefites which vve receiue from the hand of God vnder their godly care &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer vs, vvhile vve be obedient and dutifull vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, becauſe of the great and manifold euils which do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon contempt and diſobedience against them.</hi>

            <p>In the meane while: what is the more particular equitie of this Commaundement; why inferiours ſhould honour their ſuperiours?</p>

            <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe our elders in yeares, ſpecially ſuch of them as are auncient in grace and godlineſſe, they are honoured by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as it vvere vvith a Crovvne of glorie in that reſpect: and ſo are made examples of Gods conſtant goodneſſe and mercie in the prolonging of their liues before our eyes.

            <p>All the godly kings are mirrors of Gods bleſſing this way, as the holy ſtories of them do declare.</p>

               <hi>They ſhall be filled with dayes (as the Lord ſayth by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah) and he that is an hundreth yeares old, ſhall dye a young man, chapter</hi> 65.20. <hi>Reade alſo verſe</hi> 22. <hi>And Iob chap.</hi> 5.26. <hi>They ſhall go to their graue as corne which commeth in due ſeaſon into the barne.</hi>

            <p>Thus large is the bleſſing of this Commandement, which ſpreadeth it ſelfe farre and neare, ouer high and low: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all good proportion ought it accordingly to be very carefully regarded and obeyed of all: or elſe we muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the curſe ſo much the more iuſtly due vnto vs. And this we are hencefoorth to ſearch out for the awaking of our drowſie conſciences, as we haue done the bleſſings that they might be as a treaſury of comfort vnto vs, while we inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to walke in the holy wayes of God in our ſeuerall callings, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>God doth for this cauſe, in his iuſt diſpleaſure, ſometimes diſſolue the good order of pollicy and gouernement, vvhich he had eſtabliſhed for the common benefit of his people, either by ſetting ouer them euill Rulers, or leauing them to confuſed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies and rebellions from among themſelues, or elſe by giuing them ouer into the hands of tyrants and forrayne Lords and gouernours.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>He is therein a curſe to himſelfe: for he troubleth his owne fleſh, he hindreth the ioy of his owne heart, and interrupteth the courſe bleſſed of prayer, which is one of the beſt factors and friends that the married couple hath.</hi> 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 3.7.</p>

            <p>What is the curſe againſt ſuch aged perſons as haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to walke wiſely, and as it beſeemeth their yeares, for the good example of their youngers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though a ſinner do euill an hundreth times, and God ſhould prolong his dayes, yet I know that it ſhall not go well with him, becauſe he feareth not before God, Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12.13. <hi>And Iſaiah chap.</hi> 65.20. <hi>The ſinner being an hundreth yeares old ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi>

Reue. 14.13. So on the contrary, they whoſe ſins accompany them to their death, and in their death, muſt of neceſſity be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point: what proofe haue you of the curſe againſt thoſe that do not giue mutuall honour one to another: yea, the more honourable to the baſer, the richer to the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the learned to the vnlearned, and much rather if one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall do not ſo to another, ſeruant to ſeruant, brother to brother, poore to poore, and rich to rich? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſinner (ſayth the holy Prouerbe) deſpiſeth his neighbour (and ſo conſequently is accurſed:) But he that hath mercy on the poore is bleſſed, chap.</hi> 14.21. <hi>And chap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>When pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, then commeth ſhame: but with the lowly is wiſedome.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus farre of the curſes. And thus we ſee, how euen as God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:182:81"/> bleſſeth euery dutie of obedience,<note place="margin">Euery man is a damnable tranſgreſſor.</note> both in this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement and in the reſt: ſo both here and euery where, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his Law, which is not accurſed in his ſight: &amp; to the which ſome ſpeciall puniſhment or other doth not belong, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that we reade, Heb. chap. 2.2.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, that according to the courſe of our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, we may come to the vſe of this Commaundement: Haue you ſo obeyed it, that you may eſcape theſe curſes, and obtaine the former bleſſings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No: but contrariwiſe, I haue infinitely tranſgreſſed it, aboue that I know againſt my ſelfe, both in thought, word, and deed: ſo that vnleſſe happily I may find fauour with God, through the perfect redemption and obedience vvhich Ieſus Chriſt hath wrought, I muſt of neceſſity periſh in my ſinnes, which I haue committed againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This verily is not onely your eſtate, but it is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery mothers ſonne among vs: yea, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eſtate of all, both of parents and children, of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſubiects, of paſtors and people, of maiſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, of young and old, of poore and rich, of learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By Ieſus Chriſt onely are we redeemed through his bloud, from the curſes and puniſhments due to the tranſgreſſions of this Commandement: and by him alone alſo are we made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the bleſſings promiſed to the obedience of it: proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwayes (as muſt be vnderſtood in euery commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that we truly beleeue in his moſt bleſſed name, repent of our ſinnes, and indeuour to walke more and more in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of it.</p>

            <p>What proofe haue you that our Sauiour Chriſt hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilled the obedience of this Commandement for you, and for ſo many as ſhall truly beleeue in him, and repent of their ſinnes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereof, through the goodneſſe of God, vve haue very euident and manifold confirmation in the holy Scriptures, to our ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort.</hi>

            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:182:82"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obedience.</note>Which are thoſe manifold confirmations, whereof we haue ſo comfortable euidence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are partly ſuch as giue teſtimony of his perfect obedience to man, in euery eſtate of inferiority and ſubiection, whereunto it pleaſed him of his owne accord to ſubmit himſelfe for our ſakes, though he were the Lord of glory: whom all both men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtand bound to worſhip, honour and ſerue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And partly, they are ſuch as do witneſſe his perfect obedience to God, in a moſt gracious courſe of gouernement, in reſpect of that ſuperiority which he receiued aboue all creatures, in that he alone was and is for euer found worthy, to be the onely media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore inquire of theſe things in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what proofe haue you that he was perfectly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his naturall parents, that is, to the Virgin Mary his mother, and to Ioſeph though he was but his father in law, as one may ſay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 2. <hi>chap. of the Euangeliſt Luke, verſe</hi> 51. <hi>it is expreſly teſtified that he was ſubiect to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, no doubt it is the meaning of the Euangeliſt, that he was conſtantly ſubiect to them, ſo that he moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed them in all things, as might beſt beſeeme a moſt dutifull child: that is, ſo farre as might ſtand with that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall dutie, wherein he well knew himſelfe chiefly bound to his heauenly father, whereof we haue ſufficient proofe from time to time, yea, euen from the beginning, as is plaine in the ſame text, verſes 48.49. And againe afterward, Iohn 2.4. and Matth. 12.48.49.50. and Luke chapter 11.27.28. Yea, ſo farre was he obedient, that he willingly ſubmitted himſelfe, to be euen as a ſeruant, or a manuall artificer, to worke in workes of Ioſeph his fathers ſcience or trade or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, euen to the time that he was to manifeſt himſelfe, to be that Prophet ſent of God to Iſrael: that is, vntill he was about thirtie yeares of age, as we may ſee Matth. 13.54.55.56. Is not this the carpenters ſonne, ſay the people, who knew his bringing vp? And more expreſly, Marke 6.2.3. Is not this the carpenter Maries ſonne? whence then hath
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:182:82"/> he this wiſedome? And Luke 3.23. whereby it is euident, that for all that time his education was not ſtudient-like at lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for then there had not bene ſo great reaſon of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and queſtion.</p>
            <p>And that we may be confirmed by a teſtimony aboue all exception, concerning his moſt perfect loue and thankefulneſſe to his mother, for her tender and motherly care ouer him, and for her paines in nourcing of him vp in his infancy, ſhe trauelling with him into Egypt, &amp;c. let vs duly conſider that which the Euangeliſt Saint Iohn writeth Chapter 19.26.27. in that euen in his agonies vppon the croſſe, he taketh care for the comfortable maintenance of his mother after his death; and it ſhall be inſtead of a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
            <p>This therefore may ſuffice for the proofe of his moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience in the duty of a child.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of his perfect obedience as he was in the forme of a ſubiect, though indeed he was not by right a ſubiect to any earthly Prince in Iſrael: for King Dauid ſpeaking by the holy Ghoſt, called Chriſt his Lord, Pſalme 110. and Math. 22.43.44. much leſſe was he a ſubiect to the forraine vſurpation of the Romane Empire?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue an euident proofe hereof, in that he refuſeth to be made a king, though the people vvould haue done ſo, Iohn chapter</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in that he profeſſed plainly that his kingdome is not of this world, Iohn</hi> 18.36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in that he himſelfe payed tribute, and taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they alſo ſhould do ſo, Mathevv</hi> 17.24. <hi>&amp;c. and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 22. <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of his perfect obedience to the miniſterie of the word, ſo long as he was in his priuate eſtate, and in the place of a hearer and diſciple, to receiue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God at the inſtruction of the Prieſts of the Law, whoſe lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, and at whoſe mouth all were to ſeeke the Law of God, by the holy ordinance and appointment of God himſelfe?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of his perfect obedience, in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courſe of conuerſation going before his elders in yeares as alſo all other, in giuing honour, yea euen to the pooreſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing he is faithfull and true, and one that ſought not his owne glory, but the glorie of him that ſent him, as vve reade Iohn</hi> 7.18. <hi>and Chapter</hi> 8.49.50.54.55. <hi>vve may boldly reſt in his owne teſtimonie, concerning that vvhich he ſayth of himſelfe: I am meeke and lowly in heart, Mathevv</hi> 11.29. <hi>according to the Propheſie of Iſaiah, Chapter</hi> 42.1.2.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue alſo his practiſe ioyned vvith his doctrine, Luke</hi> 14.7. <hi>&amp;c. to the</hi> 15. <hi>verſe: vvhere he both reproueth the pride and ambition of thoſe that ſought to ſit in the higheſt roomes at feaſts, and alſo teacheth that the pooreſt of all ſhould not be thought vnworthy to be inuited, and to haue their meete and conuenient place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as touching his practiſe, vve haue a moſt liuely proofe in that he vvas among his Diſciples, not onely as a maiſter and Lord, but rather as a moſt louing, ſweete, and familiar bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or friend, Iohn</hi> 15.13.14.15. <hi>Yea, euen as a ſeruant, in that he vvaſhed his Diſciples feete: he thereby, of purpoſe giuing them an example of all humble ſeruice, and of mutuall loue among themſelues, Chapter</hi> 13.4. <hi>&amp;c. yea he profeſſeth that he came not to be ſerued, but to ſerue, Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>and Luke chapter</hi> 22.27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And beſide, we haue to the ſame purpoſe a moſt notable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Apoſtles: As firſt of Paule, Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c. where from the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, the most humble man that euer vvas, he perſwadeth all Chriſtians to the ſame moſt excellent vertue.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe teſtimonies do ſufficiently confirme his perfect obedience to this Commandement, in reſpect of his ſubiection in euery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of inferiority among men, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now let vs come to his perfect obedience before God, in his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereof, there are two principall points to be conſidered: his heauenly propheſie, and his ſpirituall gouernement.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of his perfect obedience in reſpect of his propheſie, and in that he was the onely true ſhepheard of the ſheepe, to guide the children of God with a parent-like affection in the wayes of the kingdome of heauen?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem (ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe) thou which killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent vnto thee: How often would I haue gathered thy children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings, and ye would not, Math.</hi> 23.37.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Math. 28.20. Reuel. 3.20. Prou. 8.30.31. He teacheth moſt clearely and faithfully, as it were fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boſome of the father, Iohn. 1.18. and chap. 4.34. and chap. 8.28.29. and chap. 12.49.50.</p>
            <p>Now, what proofe haue you that he hath perfectly obeyed the will of God, in ruling and gouerning his Church, as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall king and prince, and as a moſt tender foſter-father ouer his people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In him, and by him, are all the propheſies performed, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that most gracious and princely gouernement, promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name and kingdome of king Dauid, or any other good king of Iſrael: according to that which the holy Angell teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Virgin Mary, Luke chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 31.32.33. <hi>and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that we reade Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>verſes</hi> 3.4.5.6.</p>
            <p>Yea, by ſo much is the gouernement of our Sauiour Chriſt more gracious, then the gouernement of any other king or prince, euer could, or poſſibly can be, becauſe he onely vanquiſheth our greateſt enemies, and giueth vs that victory
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:182:84"/> which is the moſt glorious of all other:<note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obed ence for vs,</note> for he ſubdueth not onely our outward foes, but alſo our ſpirituall aduerſaries; not onely hoſts and armies of men, but alſo the legions and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Diuels that warre againſt vs.</p>
            <p>And finally, he ſetteth vs in heauenly thrones with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moſt ſweete therefore may the comfort of theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be iuſtly vnto vs.</p>
            <p>And whom of vs may they not worthily moue, to deny our ſelues, and after the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, and by his grace, to giue all due honour to euery man, and chiefly to the Lord himſelfe:<note place="margin">Our vnperfect obedience for Chriſts ſake accepted of God.</note> euery of vs contenting our ſelues with our eſtate, and vnder God walking honourably in our places and callings: that ſo God may honour vs, according to his rich mercy and free grace in Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, all worſhip, praiſe and thankeſgiuing, both now and for euermore, Amen.</p>
            <p>The ſixt Commandement followeth.</p>
            <p>Which is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill. Or, as it is more vſually Engliſhed in the ſame ſence, Thou ſhalt do no murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This latter interpretation, as it is more vſuall, ſo it is more ſignificant: wherefore we may well make choiſe to reade it thus. Thou ſhalt do no murther, like as in the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement we choſe rather to ſay, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery: Then thus, Thou ſhalt not commit fornication: though this we know, that God forbiddeth all cruelty, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſe in this Commandement, and all filthineſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe of the fleſh in the other following, as we ſhall ſee in the handling of them.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all, concerning the reaſon of the proceeding of the Lord in the publiſhing of this Law, two things ſeeme worthie to be conſidered in this place: The firſt, why the Lord doth not reſt in the former Commaundement: which is a perfect Law for the well ordering of all ſociety, if it were throughly obſerued: The ſecond, why this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement forbidding murther, hath the next place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:182:84"/>
            <p>What haue ye learned for anſwer to theſe things?<note place="margin">The ſcope of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the Lordreſteth not in the former Commandement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe that contempt of good order and gouernement, which reigneth in our nature, breaketh foorth into ſundry out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and miſchiefes, which he ſaw likewiſe neceſſary that they ſhould be expreſly mentioned and ſtraightly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, he giueth the Commaundement againſt murther the next place, becauſe, not onely in the account of man, but alſo euen in the eſtimation of God himſelfe, life is more precious then anie other vvorldly thing, vvhich man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further alſo it hath the next place, to the end that all vvhich haue any power and gouernement, may ſee vvhat that is (vvhich as touching humane ſociety) they ſtand chiefly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with: and that alſo euen to this ende, that the bleſſing of long life promiſed in the former Commandement, might not by any contrary attempt of any man, be any vvay hindred or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe indeed are the reaſons, both why the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not his Law in the former Commaundement, though one would thinke that it alone might ſuffice for the well ordering of all humaine ſocietie: and alſo, why he placeth this our preſent Commaundement nexte after that.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the interpretation:</p>
            <p>And firſt, what meane you by murther, which is the onely finne expreſly forbidden in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Murther is the vniuſt, and malicious, or vvilfull taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the life of any of mankind, by any of the ſame kind; or of our owne life by our ſelues, by vvhat vvay or meanes ſoeuer it may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, thus farre doth murther reach.</p>
            <p>But is there nothing elſe forbidden in this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes: God doth not onely forbid all outward euils, whereby this wicked murther is occaſioned, but alſo all inward and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, from whence it ſpringeth, or whereby it is any way furthered and perfected.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sinnes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>
               <hi>Yea, the Lord in this commandement ſtraightly forbiddeth the euill thought of murther, with all crafty deuiſes and practiſes wherewith any do lye in wayt for bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt needs be ſo, elſe ſhould not the Law of God be perfect: for as our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth, out of the heart come euill thoughts, murthers, &amp;c. the which do defile a man, Math. 15.19.20. Such was the murtherous thought of Eſau againſt his brother Iaacob, Gen. 27.41. Reade alſo Ezek. 22.6.</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe outward euils whereby murther is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sower, diſdainfull, and wrathfull countenances, taunting and reuiling ſpeeches, captious quarrelling and fighting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the more immediate forerunners and occaſions of murther, as daily experience ſheweth. For the ſword would not be ſo raſhly drawne as it is wont, if the tongue could be kept in the ſcabbard, as it ought to be: and if the countenance and behauior were ſo amiable as it ſhould be, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let vs go on.</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe inward affections of the heart from whence murther ſpringeth, and whereby as by the ſecret and whiſpering acceſſories and abbettors murther would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, if God ſhould not graciouſly ſtay and hinder it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are partly ſuch as be contrary to the vertues which are required to harmleſeneſſe and innocency, touching mans perſon and life. And partly, they are ſuch as be contrary to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of helpfulneſſe, concerning the reliefe, ſuccour, and comfort thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe kinds of euill, vnkind, and troubleſome affections, are indeed the breeders and hatchers of all violence and bloudy murthers.</p>
            <p>All which contrary affections, both to harmeleſneſſe, and alſo to helpfulneſſe, though they all conſent in doing of hurt: yet for the helpe of our vnderſtanding and memories, we will follow this order of diſtinction here in this negatiue part of this Commandement: becauſe it is the fitteſt order to be held af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the affirmatiue part of it.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt branch therefore of the diſtinction:</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe euill affections which be contrary to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:182:85"/> vertues of harmeleſneſſe and innocencie, touching mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are of three ſorts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the contraries of meekeneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the contraries of tractableneſſe or gentleneſſe and eaſineſſe to be intreated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the contraries of peaceableneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe therfore, let vs now henceforth inquire: And firſt, which are the contraries of meekeneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe which follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Pride, in that euerie man thinketh too highly of himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Enuie and repining at our neighbours proſperitie.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Immoderate and bitter anger, though there be neuer ſo great cauſe giuen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Deſire or purpoſe of reuenge, though reconciliation hath bene ſought, yea though ſatisfaction and recompence hath bene tendred and offered, as ſometime it falleth out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Finally, impatience, the fruites whereof are restleſſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, with curſed exclamation and complaining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contraries of tractableneſſe, or gentleneſſe &amp; eaſineſſe to be intreated, are next:</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the one hand, too great ſoftneſſe, or a ſeruile and timorous kind of blockiſhneſſe, when any ſhall paſſe by great abuſes againſt their perſon and life, or againſt anie that belong to them, and haue no care to vſe the lawfull meanes which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the remedying thereof: ſuch as are, priuate rebuke, and if that will not preuaile, publike complaint to the magiſtrate for the puniſhment of ſuch as ſhall go on in harmefull and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous practiſes, without all regard of amendement, or of ſeeking any priuate reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other hand, hardneſſe to be intreated when reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the third place, which are the contraries of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:182:86"/> the which God doth likewiſe forbid in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In one extremitie, cowardly yeelding to vnlawfull conditions of peace, or to peace it ſelfe, in ſuch caſes as we ought to vſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant reſistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the other extremitie, firſt vnapeaceableneſſe, in ſuch caſes wherein we ought to ſeeke and follow after peace with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly contentiouſneſſe, or a delight in an obſtinate courſe of brawling and contention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, inueterate hatred, or rancor and malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe are the contraries of the vertues belonging to harmeleſneſſe and innocencie, touching the life and perſons of men.</p>
            <p>Shew furthermore, which are the contraries to the vertues which belong to helpefulneſſe, concerning the reliefe, ſuccour, and comfort of life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are likewiſe of three ſorts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the contraries to the vertues of peace-making.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the contraries to thoſe vertues which belong to the repelling of iniuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the contraries to the vertues which ſerue to the well placing and beſtowing of benefites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore likewiſe inquire of theſe in the ſame order, as we haue alreadie done of the former.</p>
            <p>And firſt, which are the contrarie vices to the vertue of peace-making?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe two:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Sowing of contention, by ſecret tale-carying and priuie ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Hindering of peace and friendly agreement, by contrarie perſwaſion and counſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contraries to the vertues of the ſecond ſort are in the next place: that is, the contraries to iuſt repelling of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are partly, ſuch as be contrarie to that lawfull and iuſt reuenge, vvhich ought to be ſought at the hands of thoſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:182:86"/> that haue power to puniſh ſuch as ſhall grow miſchieuouſly iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and hurtfull to any of our neighbours and brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And partly, they are ſuch as be contrarie to that Chriſtian fortitude, vvhereby the innocent partie extreamely oppreſſed, is preſently to be releeued, or elſe he muſt periſh, or be very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly damnified, or vtterly vndone, as vve vſe to ſpeake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew therefore firſt, which thoſe vices be that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to iuſt reuenge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe foure following:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the one ſide, careleſſe and vnkind neglect of ſeeking iuſt &amp; neceſſarie reuenge, by the helpe of the godly and Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, priuate reuengement, vvith neglect of the magiſtrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, miſ-informing or bribing the magiſtrate, in an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire of reuenge aboue meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, crueltie in an ouer-eger or bitter purſuing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge and puniſhment aſſigned by the magiſtrate, though it be no greater then is equall and meete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which be the contraries to godly and Chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, cowardly fearefulneſſe and vvant of holy courage, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and warily to vndergo neceſſarie daungers, for the iust reſcue and defence of our neighbour, vvhen vve ſee him in extreame daunger, and vvhen by the courſe of ordinarie helpes vve might haue hope to do him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, indiſcreet, raſh, and preſumptuous venturouſneſſe, vvhen a man enterpriſeth any thing aboue all likelyhood of good ſucceſſe, he therein greatly indaungering himſelfe, to no benefite to his diſtreſſed neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contraries to the laſt ſort of the vertues which belong to helpefulneſſe for the reliefe, ſuccour and comfort of life, namely they that belong to the well placing and beſtowing of benefits, they are yet behind.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are of diuerſe ſorts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:182:87"/>
            <p>Rehearſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the contraries of kind-hartedneſſe, or goodnes, as the Scriptures call it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the contraries to mercifulneſſe, or tender and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el-like pitie and compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the contraries to friendſhip and friendly dealing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, the contraries to well-wiſhing or prayer, and to good and well dealing toward our enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore now laſt of all inquire out theſe kinds of contraries alſo, in ſuch order as you haue rehearſed them.</p>
            <p>And firſt, which are the contraries to kind-hartedneſſe or goodneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt ſelfe-loue, when a man thinketh all too litle for himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, euill will or vnbeteeming, when one is loth that his neighbour ſhould fare the better for him, though it be of another mans cost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, inhumanitie or churliſhneſſe, in a rude and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deniall, to ſhew that kindneſſe which is intreated of a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, faire words, but no performance, or vvith very great fayling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all, vniuſt gratifying or pleaſuring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contraries to mercifulneſſe or tender pitie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are next.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the one hand, vvant of compaſſion ouer the miſeries of ſuch as ought to be pitied: as alſo laughing and reioycing at ſhrevvd and vnhappie turnes, as vve call them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And on the other hand, fooliſh pitie, in ſparing ſuch as are vvorthie of ſharpe ſeueritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place are the contraries to friendſhip &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealing:</p>
            <p>Rehearſe likewiſe which they be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, hoſtilitie, or open enmitie. And then diuerſe other, as they follovv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, lightneſſe in the entring and breaking off of friendſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, fayned friendſhip or flatterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, neglecting or fayling a mans ſpeciall friend in the time of his ſpeciall neede.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:182:87"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all, vnlavvfull or vniuſt befriending.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contraries to wel-wiſhing &amp; well dealing toward our enemies, are now onely remaining: Which be they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe tvvo:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, raſh and hatefull imprecations or curſed vviſhes againſt them, proceeding of that priuate grudge vvhich vve beare them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, profane and carnall reioycing at their aduerſitie and fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue we through the grace of God, the whole inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Gods meaning in the negatiue part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <p>But can you ſhew me the reaſon, why the Lord forbidding ſo many ſinnes; maketh expreſſe mention onely of murther: and why vnder that one he comprehendeth all the reſt, euen from the greateſt to the leaſt of them: which courſe alſo, the Lord taketh in the next Commaundement, and alſo in the 8. and in the 9.</p>
            <p>Shew here once for all, what the generall reaſons hereof may be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue learned that there are ſundrie very notable reaſons of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would gladly heare you to make rehearſall of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, the Lord doth it for plaineneſſe, leaſt any ſhould ſay, that through vveakeneſſe of capacitie they could not vnderſtand his Lavves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, for breuitie and ſhortneſſe ſake, leaſt anie ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that becauſe of the length of them, they are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, to let vs vnderſtand, that all the affections and thoughts from vvhence ſuch grieuous ſinnes proceeded, be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo great and grieuous offences in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that by the more effectuall avvaking and rouſing vp of our drowſie conſciences, our ſoules might be ſoone poſſeſſed with ſuch a feare and horrour of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinnes, that vve might the rather be preſerued from the leſſer, vvhich vve ſhould othervviſe too lightly regard, and at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvares eaſily runne into them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thus obſerued in this place, both concerning
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:182:88"/> this preſent Commaundement:<note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> and alſo concerning the 7. 8. and 9. following:</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the affirmatiue part of this Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: what doth God require of vs in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this</hi> 6. <hi>Commaundement the Lord our God commaundeth all thoſe vertues, which belong either to innocencie or harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, touching the perſon or life of man: or elſe to helpefulneſſe for the reliefe and comfort of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe vertues haue bene mentioned alreadie, according to their ſeuerall kinds, in the negatiue part of this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but now we are more purpoſedly to inquire of them, ſeeing to this affirmatiue part they do properly belong.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, which are thoſe vertues which belong to innocencie and harmeleſneſſe, as touching the perſon and life of man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, meekeneſſe or patience and long ſuffering, vvhich ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue lightly paſſeth by and endureth all ſuch offences done againſt our ſelues, or anie that belong vnto vs, vvhich dutie doth not neceſſarily bind vs to ſtand earnestly vpon, in the reprouing, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and purſuing of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, tractableneſſe, or gentleneſſe, and eaſineſſe to be intreated, to forgiue the treſpaſſe; yea though great anger or diſpleaſure hath of any of vs beene iustly conceiued againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe indeede are the vertues which appertaine to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and harmeleſneſſe, according to the Commaundement of our Sauiour Chriſt: Be ye ſimple as doues, Matth. 10.16.</p>
            <p>Shew now which they be that belong to helpefulneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They may be referred to three heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are they of the firſt ſort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ſuch as belong to peace-making betvveene neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and brethren offended: as, louing perſvvaſion and gentle
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:182:88"/> intreatie, yea euen a certaine compelling of them to be friends, if poſſibly they may by any meanes be ouercome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are the vertues of the ſecond ſort belonging to help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ſuch as ſerue to the iuſt repelling of iniuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhich are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are lawfull reuenge, and holy fortitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What meane you by lawfull reuenge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lawfull reuenge is, vvhen vvithout all hatred or bitterneſſe againſt the perſon of the offender, and onely in pure zeale againſt iniurious dealing, the vnreaſonable and obſtinate partie which by no priuate perſwaſion vvill be intreated, is purſued in courſe of common iuſtice before the magiſtrate, vntill vpon iuſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſute he haue receiued his due puniſhment, if it may be obtained, or at the leaſt be brought to yeeld himſelfe to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe from his former iniurious and miſchieuous courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhat is that vertue which you call holy fortitude?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holy fortitude, is that godly boldneſſe or ſtoutneſſe of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, vvhich is imployed in the priuate defence of the innocent partie, vvhen for the preſent he is in extreame and vrgent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, or of any other imminent miſchiefe from his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and vehement aduerſarie, but cannot enioy ſo ſpeedie prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and defence from the publike magiſtrate, as his neceſſitie requireth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of the ſecond ſort of the vertues belonging to helpefulneſſe. Which are the third ſort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ſuch as belong to the well placing and beſtovving of benefites, for the refreſhing and comfort of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs heare you make rehearſall of them, as you haue done of the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is kindhartedneſſe or goodneſſe, as the ſcriptures do call it: vvhich is a generall readineſſe and diſpoſition of the mind and vvill of a man, to helpe and ſuccour, for the preuenting of all extremitie of euill, to the vttermoſt of a mans povver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is mercifulneſſe, or tender and bovvel-like pitie and compaſſion: vvhich is a more particular readineſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the mind and vvill, to helpe and ſuccour vpon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of any preſent neceſſitie or miſerie.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:182:89"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Equitie.</note>
               <hi>The third is friendſhip or friendly dealing, for the cheriſhing and increaſing of mutuall loue among neighbours and friends, though they be in no neceſſitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth is vvell vviſhing and prayer, euen for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and ill willers: with the practiſe of loue and kindneſſe, both in word and deede, for the ouercomming and winning of them to the loue of God and of his truth, and of our ſelues if it may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto of the interpretation, both of the negatiue, and alſo of the affirmatiue part of this Commaundement.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to that which remaineth to be yet further conſidered as belonging to the ſame: And firſt, what is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe God hath created vs, and giuen vs life, and many excellent gifts according to his owne diuine image &amp; likeneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe he hath giuen vs beeing and life to ſingular ends and purpoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe the taking away of life, is the bereauing of him from whome it is taken, of all the benefits &amp; bleſſings which God hath giuen for the ioy and comfort of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, becauſe he that murthereth and taketh avvay the life of another, destroyeth the image of God, firſt in himſelfe, and then alſo maketh himſelfe guiltie of his owne death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, becauſe through the benefite of this Lavv of God, vve enioy our ovvne liues in ſafetie and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly, becauſe God hath ſo diſpoſed of his manifold gifts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manifold neceſſarie buſineſſes and labours of this life, that euerie one ſtandeth in neede of the helpe or ſeruice of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But moſt of all, becauſe vve being by the grace of God Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are not onely by creation and naturall birth, of one and the ſame kind of fleſh and bloud, but alſo by regeneration &amp; nevv birth in Chriſt Ieſus, vve are by a more neare and holy bond ioyned together in one ſpirit, baptiſed vvith one Baptiſme, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vp as at one table in the houſe and family of God, appoynted to the ſame euerlaſting inheritance of glorie in the life to come, if vve ſhall liue peaceably and godly, as becommeth the children of God, the time of our ſhort and tranſitorie life here in this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The equitie of this holy and iuſt Commandement of God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:182:89"/> reſting vpon ſo many excellent grounds and reaſons,<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note> doth not onely iuſtifie the commandement it ſelfe, but alſo confirmeth all the curſes which God the righteous giuer thereof, threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt euerie tranſgreſſion of it.</p>
            <p>To the rehearſall of which curſes, from the teſtimonie and repetitions thereof out of the booke of God, we are now in the courſe of our order come.</p>
            <p>Wherefore firſt of all, what is the curſe of this Law of God, againſt the grieuous ſinne of murther?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ciuill courſe of Gods iuſtice, allowed alſo euen by the light of naturall reaſon in all nations, it is the temporall and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death of the murtherer, and by the eternall ſentence of God, the death both of body and ſoule for euer and euer. For ſo vve reade first in the</hi> 35. <hi>chapter of the booke of Numbers; and then Reuel. chap.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Murtherers ſhall haue their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here let vs note, that as there are degrees of murther, ſome more horrible then other, ſo the puniſhment thereof ſhall be, from the diuine ſentence of God for euer. Yea euen among men, we ſee the practiſe of this equitie, that he which ſhall but intend the murthering of his Prince, is more ſhamefully execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then if he ſhould haue committed the act of murther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a priuate man.</p>
            <p>And the heathen knew not what puniſhment might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, miſerable and execrable enough, for him that ſhould murther his father or mother.</p>
            <p>Let vs note alſo, that though there are diuerſe kinds of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes and courſes, which murtherers take to bring their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to paſſe; ſome ſeeking to hide their ſinne one way, and ſome another, yet howſoeuer they go to worke, they are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way accurſed in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Hereof let vs ſee ſome teſtimonies: What is the curſe againſt ſuch as (though they lay no violent hands vpon a man) yet commit murther vnder a colourable pretence of iuſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proceeding?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may take king Ahab for a memorable example, vnto vvhome the Lord ſaith by his Prophet Elijah: Hast thou kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gotten poſſeſſion? In the place where dogges licked the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:182:90"/> bloud of Naboth, ſhall dogges euen licke thy bloud alſo ſaith the Lord,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings chap.</hi> 21.19.</p>
            <p>Yea let vs marke, that the Lord threateneth the heauie curſe againſt king Ahab, although he was ſicke and kept his chamber, when Naboth was by falſe witneſſes brought to his death: ſo as it might ſeeme that he had no hand in it. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not be, but he muſt vnderſtand of Iezabell his wiues practiſe againſt Naboth, (for it was done in a publike &amp; ſolemne manner.) Therefore becauſe he ſtayed it not, God puniſheth him, as if he had bene the principall agent. But not onely Ahab was accurſed but Iezabell alſo, as it followeth in the ſame text:</p>
            <p>What was her curſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord ſaith likewiſe concerning Iezabell: The dogges ſhall eate Iezabell by the wall of Iſraell, verſe</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet further against Ahab, in the</hi> 24. <hi>verſe: The dogges ſhall eate him of Ahabs ſtocke that dyeth in the citie, and him that dyeth in the field ſhall the foules of the ayre eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The accompliſhment of theſe curſes we reade, firſt, againſt Ahab, in the very next chapter, verſe 38. and againſt Iezabel though ſhe ouer liued Ahab; and alſo againſt Ahabs ſtocke: 2. booke of the Kings chapter 9. verſes 6.7.8.9.10. and verſe 30. &amp;c. to the ende of the Chapter.

            <p>But there be other that go yet ſomething more cloſely to worke, then if they ſhould ſo openly forge wrong for a law.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curſed be he (ſaith the Lord) that ſmiteth his neighbour ſecretly, and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen, Deuteronomy</hi> 27.24. <hi>And verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Curſed be he that taketh a revvard to put to death innocent bloud, and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt him that cruelly hacketh and mangleth anie mans fleſh, albeit he do not purſue him to death?</p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>This is the law of reuenge, which God both commaundeth his Magiſtrates, and alſo practiſeth himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And let vs obſerue, that this curſe is threatened in ſpeciall maner againſt thoſe that deale iniuriouſly and cruelly againſt the poorer ſort, the widow, the fatherleſſe, the ſtraunger, the blind, the lame, &amp;c. becauſe they are moſt ſuccourleſſe. Reade Exod. 22. verſes 21.22.23.24. And againe Deuteronomy 24.14.15. and chapter 27.18. Curſed be he that maketh the blind to go out of the way, &amp;c. And Prouerbes chapter 22. verſes 24.25.

Read alſo Iſa. 1.23. and Ierem. 5.28.</p>
            <p>VVhat is the curſe againſt the vſurer, which ſpoileth the poore that way?</p>
            <p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:182:93"/> For I was hungrie, and ye gaue me meate. Thus in the Epiſtle of Iames chap. 2.13. mercie is ſaid to reioyce againſt iudgement. He that is mercifull rewardeth his owne ſoule, Prouerb. 11.17. and chapt. 17.19. He that is mercifull to the poore lendeth to the Lord, and the Lord wil recompence that which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. It cauſeth great comfort to the conſcience, in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods loue. Reade 1. Iohn 3.17.18.19.20.21.22.23. Reade alſo Luke 14.12.13.14. When thou makeſt a dinner, &amp;c. bid the poore, &amp;c. (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt.) and thou ſhalt be bleſſed, becauſe they cannot recompence thee: for thou ſhalt be recompenced at the reſurrection of the iuſt.</p>
            <p>It followeth, that we conſider of the bleſſing of God vpon friendly dealing, yea euen toward thoſe that be not poore or in preſent miſery, one Chriſtian friend to another, for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reioycing and comfort in the wayes of God.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionathan had the bleſſing of God vpon his faithfull and godly friendſhip toward Dauid before he vvas King: in that God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Dauid after that he vvas King, vvhen Ionathan vvas now dead, to recompence his friendſhip by friendly &amp; mercifull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tovvard his poſteritie.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam. chapt.</hi> 9.1.2.3. <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>You do well in reſtrayning the bleſſing to holy and godly friendſhip; for as touching meere ciuill or worldly friendſhip in carnall reſpects, when men delight in companying together for good cheare, and for paſtime ſake, at the tables or cardes, or in the bowling-alley, &amp;c. ſuch friendſhip commeth into no reckening before the Lord One carnall friend hath his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with another.

            <p>A proofe whereof we haue in the place a litle before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Luke 14.12. And againe chapter 6.32.33.34. If you loue them that loue you, what thanke ſhall ye haue? for euen ſinners loue them that loue them, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>They therefore that be truly wiſe, will auoide ſuch waſt and loſt workes: they will not worke thus for naught, ſeeing the Lord hath prepared ſo many bleſſed workes for vs to walke in. Euery worke is loſt labour, which God doth not vndertake to bleſſe and reward.</p>
            <p>But godly friendſhip no doubt is a vertue, to the which the bleſſing of God belongeth.</p>
            <p>The bleſſing of thoſe that are louing and kind, not onely to their godly friends, but euen to their enemies alſo, in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to forgiue them, and in their need to helpe them, &amp;c. the bleſſing (I ſay) of theſe is yet behind: What proofe haue you that God will bleſſe ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followeth in the ſame place of Luke, chapter</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 35. <hi>wherefore (ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt) loue ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, looking for nothing againe, and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the children of the moſt high: for he is kind to the vnkind, and to the euill. Be ye therefore merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as your father alſo is mercifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade alſo Prouerbs 25.21.22. If he that hateth thee be hungry, giue him bread, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Lord will recompence thee. But in the place of Luke, our Sauiour Chriſt doth moſt liuely ſet forth the excellency of this dutie in the ſight of God, by the bleſſing which he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to belong vnto it.</p>
            <p>And verily, the Lord will be ſo much the more carefull in that caſe to make recompence, not onely becauſe all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſuch is moſt vnthankefully accepted at their hands; but chiefly becauſe the children of God do in this duty moſt of all deny themſelues: yea, becauſe herein they haue the greateſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer themſelues.</p>
            <p>Hitherto both of the interpretation, and alſo of the equity, and of the curſe, and now laſt of all of the bleſſing belonging to this Commandemnt.</p>

            <p>Haue you perfectly obeyed this holy &amp; righteous Coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God: that is, haue you bene ſo perfectly meeke, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, peaceable, &amp;c. and haue you bene ſo helpefull euery way to euery body: yea, euen to thoſe whom you take to be your

            <p>
               <hi>No: but contrariwiſe I find my ſelfe to be by nature cruelly and ſpitefully minded: for vpon euery occaſion I am eaſily prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to anger, and to reuiling ſpeeches, quarelling and fighting: I am very apt to wiſh euill, and to ſeeke reuenge, either openly or priuately, againſt all that I imagine to do me the leaſt wrong, and therefore I muſt needs acknowledge my ſelfe to be ſo farre from the bleſſing of this Commaundement, that the curſe is due to me: yea, I am already vnder it, ſaue that I truſt God vvill for Chriſt Ieſus ſake, haue mercy vpon me, and forgiue me my ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, both concerning your ſelfe, and euery one of vs. The Scripture ſaith not in vaine: The ſpirit which is in vs lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth after enuie, Iames 4.5. Reade alſo the beginning of the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, let vs marke and we ſhall perceiue, that when the Spirit of God mindeth to ſet out the corruption of our nature (as he doth oftentimes in his holy Scriptures) he ſtandeth much vpon this point, to deſcribe how exceeding cruell and reuengefull we are, euen reſembling the Diuell, by whom we are peruerted, who was himſelfe a murtherer from the beginning. Reade Iſaiah chapter 1.15. Your hands are full of bloud, that is, of cruelty. And chapter 11.6. we are in our naturall corruption compared to the Wolfe, Leopard, Lyon, Beare, Aſpe, Cock-atriſe. And chapter 59.3. Your hands are defiled with bloud, &amp;c. And the like, Pſalme 14.3.4. and Ro. 3.10. &amp;c. Yea we thinke it great reaſon, that we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue euery man as good as they bring: that is, that we may lawfully reuenge our ſelues to the vttermoſt, &amp;c. We ſee how little children will ſtriue to giue the laſt ſtroke or tap. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſtrength of this ſinne, we haue a liuely patterne in Lamech, Geneſis. 4.23.24. Heare my voice, &amp;c. I would ſlay a man for my greater wound, and a young man for my leſſer hurt.</p>
            <p>It is euident therefore, that vnleſſe we find redemption
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:182:94"/> and iuſtification by our Sauiour Chriſt, we cannot but periſh for euer in theſe our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And this we are the rather to obſerue in this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe our cruelties and bloudy ſinnes are not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe waſhed away, but by the bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt, and by his induring of all cruell and hard dealings at the hands of men, and all ſeuerity of puniſhment from the hand of God for our ſakes. For without bloud there is no remiſſion of ſinnes, Heb. 9.22.23. &amp;c. Yea note, that as the height of our ſinfull corruption appeareth generally againſt vs all in this, that both Iewes and Gentiles conſpired in moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and deſpitefull maner, to put our Sauiour Chriſt the Lord of life and glory, to a moſt reprochfull and curſed death: ſo on the contrary, the infinite perfection of Gods mercy ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth foorth moſt brightly, in ſo much as he hath appointed that to be the onely meanes of our eternall redemption and ſaluation, which alone in his iuſtice might haue bene as the broade ſeale of our euerlaſting condemnation, according to that we reade Mathew 22.33.34. &amp;c. And againe, Luke chap. 20. verſe 9. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wonderfull therefore is this mercy of our God, whereby the bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh better things for vs, then the bloud of Abell did againſt Caine, Hebrewes chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 12. verſe 24. For this bloud cleanſeth vs from all ſinne, 1. Iohn, chapter 1.7. Yet ſo, as if we would haue forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of murther with Dauid, of hatred with Ioſephes bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of perſecution with Paule, &amp;c. we muſt repent with them in godly ſorrow for the ſame, or any other our ſinnes in the ſame kind, againſt this holy Commandement. Yea further, we muſt labour not onely to be harmeleſſe, but more and more to be helpefull, to the preſeruation and comfort of life, &amp;c. For the power of our Sauiour Chriſt his death to the mortifying of ſinne, and to the quickening of vs vnto newneſſe of life, goeth alwayes with the merite and worthineſſe of his death, to take away the guiltineſſe of ſinne, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Who was more tender hearted then Paule after he was conuerted, &amp;c.</p>

               <note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obedience for vs.</note>But that your faith may be eſtabliſhed to beleeue in Chriſt for your redemption, touching your tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Commandement: and that he is your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the obedience of it:</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you that he hath perfectly obeyed it for you? And firſt touching his innocency and harmleſneſſe, with all the vertues belonging thereunto, what proofe haue you thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue a full proofe of our Sauiour Chriſt his perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, in that it is truly teſtified of him, that euen then, when he was moſt grieuouſly oppreſſed and prouoked by his enemies, yet he did not open his mouth; for ſo it is written: He was brought as a ſheepe vnto the ſlaughter, and as the ſheepe is dumbe before the ſhearer, ſo opened he not his mouth, Iſa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>And</hi> 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.23.24.25. <hi>When he was reuiled he reuiled not againe, when he ſuffered he threatned not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as touching his perfect meekneſſe in obedience to God, euen then vvhen he did beare the moſt heauy burthen of our ſinnes, and did drinke the bittereſt cup of Gods vvrath that might be, euen dregges and all: it is further moſt faithfully teſtified, that he did not vvith the leaſt diſcontentment mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt it, but in all reuerence humbly prayeth: My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not my vvill but thine be done, Matth.</hi> 26.36. <hi>&amp;c. and Luke</hi> 22.42.</p>
            <p>Theſe are indeed very ſufficient proofes: for if there had bene any vnaduiſed anger, or any other bitter affection in him, it would then ſurely haue broken foorth and vttered it ſelfe, when he had moſt vehement prouocation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Moſes though when he liued he was the meekeſt man that was vpon the earth, yet when he was prouoked, he ſpake vnaduiſedly at a certaine time: but ſo did our Sauiour Chriſt neuer. He was ſometime angry indeed, but with a holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not of impatience or vnbeleefe, but for the vnbeleefe and hardneſſe of heart that was in the people, he together with his anger mourning for them, Reade Marke 3.5. yea though his wicked aduerſaries did of purpoſe prouoke him,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:182:95"/> what they could, yet were they not able to put his holy ſoule out of patience, Luke 11.53.54.</p>
            <p>He was therefore a perfect well ſtayed man, ſeeing he knew how to be angry without ſinne, neither offended in his tongue. For if any man ſinne not in word (ſayth the Apoſtle Iames) he is a perfect man, chap. 3.2.</p>
            <p>Thus then it is euident, that our Sauiour Chriſt was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent and harmeleſſe, Hebr. 7.26.</p>
            <p>Shew likewiſe what proofe you haue of his perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in doing all good, in ſhewing mercy, pity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and in deliuering and ſauing all ſuch as it was meete for him (according to the appointment of God) to ſuccour and releeue, and to deliuer and ſaue?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is ſo manifeſt in all things recorded of him in the holy Goſpell, both touching his vvord and vvorkers, and alſo touching the very thoughts and intents of his heart, that it can be no more hidden then the Sunne ſhining in the full brightneſſe of it. His doctrine is a moſt gracious and ſauing doctrine, and altogether tending to ſettle and confirme all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, both betwixt God and man, and alſo betwixt men among themſelues.

            <p>It is that ſinne which is forbidden Leuit. 18. verſe 20. where the Lord doth more plainely expreſſe what it is.</p>
            <p>It is committed alſo, if any vpon vniuſt diuorces marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, while their former yoke-fellowes do liue, Marke 10. verſes 11.12. and Matth. 5.32. and chap. 19. verſe 9. and Luke 16.18.</p>
            <p>Yea the husband committeth adultery, if he take any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife to the former, though he do not put her away, but keepe her ſtill as his wife, together with the other.</p>
            <p>This ſinne is forbidden, Leuit. 18.18. <hi>Vide Tremel, &amp; Iunij interpretationes &amp; annotationes,</hi> Deutronomie 17.17. and chapter 24.1.2.3.4. and Mal. chapter 2.14.15.16. See <hi>Tremel</hi> Matth. 19.3.4.5. and 1. Cor. 7.2. The eſpouſed party breaking the faith of her mariage promiſe, committeth adultery, though as yet ſhe is not maried, and therefore hath the adulterers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by the Law of God, Deut. chap. 22. verſes 23.24.</p>
            <p>Thus adultery is forbidden, howſoeuer it is committed.</p>
            <p>But is there no ſinne elſe forbidden in this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a tranſgreſſion againſt the law of mariage, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vnfaithfull breach and violating of the couenant thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord no doubt forbiddeth euery intemperate and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend or diſhonourable abuſe of mariage, betwixt thoſe which be already maried: yea, and all light, wanton and vnaduiſed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes or thoughts, which any haue with themſelus, to make ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance into that eſtate hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for mariage being in it ſelfe a very reuerend and honourable ordinance of God, Heb. 13.4. there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it ſhould be euery way reuerendly and honourably, both enterpriſed and dealt with. The ſinne therefore and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors on either hand, are to be auoided.</p>
            <p>Which are the ſinnes and errors to be auoided concerning entrance into them aried eſtate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are partly ſuch as do concerne the mind and inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:182:97"/> of thoſe that intend mariage, and partly ſuch as do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their outward perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which are thoſe that concerne the mind?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When any do not eſteeme reuerendly of mariage, as of the good and honourable ordinance of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When ſuch as haue in ſome meaſure an honourable eſtimation of it, do not yet in their minding of mariage reſpect the right ends, or not the principall ends principally. When ſuch as reſpect the right ends, yea, and the principall ends principally, yet haue not due care to prepare themſelues with meete gifts, either for wiſedome and gouernement, or for an honeſt and conuenient trade of life and calling, to liue and maintaine a family thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, when ſuch as are in ſome good meaſure prepared with all meete gifts for their condition and eſtate, do inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect and aſpire after mariage with ſuch as be aboue their degree, while they ſuffer their hearts to be ſtolen away by beauty or riches, or any like vaine and dangerous temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe indeed are ſinnes and errours of the mind, contrary to the right maner of intending and deſiring mariage. Now which may the errours be, concerning the perſons of ſuch as ſhall intend mariage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When either the one or both of them are vnfit, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the firſt childhood, which is not farre inough from the cradle: or by reaſon of that which we call the ſecond childhood, which by the courſe of nature is too neare the graue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When ſuch intend to marry, who (though for yeares they are meete) yet the one of them is not meete, through ſome defect in nature, or through ſome noyſome or contagious diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then eſpecially is the enterpriſe of mariage vnlawfull, when the perſons ſo intending, are ſuch whom neareneſſe of bloud, or of affinity and kindred by mariage, doth forbid: ſuch as God forbiddeth to marrie together in the eighteenth Chapter of Leuiticus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: and this now laſt mentioned, is that ſinne which is called inceſt, becauſe it is a ſpeciall breach of chaſtity: yea, as though it ſhould be ſayd, that ſuch are altogether voyd of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, whoſoeuer regard not to auoyd ſuch inceſtuous defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are here rehearſed.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:182:97"/>
            <p>Such therefore are the errors and ſinnes to be auoided, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching entrance into mariage.</p>
            <p>There are alſo abuſes of mariage it ſelfe, as hath bene fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned in the former anſwer: but I leaue that to the conſideration of thoſe that be maried, from the ſpeech which was directed to them for their more particular inſtruction and admonition that way; according to that which is written in diuerſe places of the holy Scriptures: ſuch as we reade 1. Cor. 7.3.4.5. Leuiticus 18. verſe 19. and chapter 12. with ſome cautions againſt ceremonious ſcruple, and chapter 15. verſe 25.</p>
            <p>Hitherto concerning the ſinne of adultery, and of thoſe other errours and ſinnes which are againſt the Law of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Let vs now go forward.</p>
            <p>What other ſinne of vncleanneſſe is forbidden in this Commandement beſide adultery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord our God doth here alſo ſtraightly forbid thoſe ſinnes vvhich are knowne by the name of fornication: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that vvhich is otherwiſe called vvhoredome, practiſed in the ſtewes or brothell houſes, by common harlots, vvhores, and ſtrumpets, vvith all ſuch as vvill giue them the priſe and hire of their vvickedneſſe: but alſo that vvhich vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and through ſpeciall temptation, is committed by ſuch ſingle perſons as neuer committed the like before: vvhether they did it in mutuall purpoſe and promiſe of mariage, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawfull eſpouſage, or after betrothment and contracting, vvhile yet the mariage hath not bene ſolemnized: or vvhether they did it vvithout any purpoſe of mariage, or vvith a falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thereof on either part, which maketh the ſinne ſo much the more grieuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but it doth ſo: as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e gathered from that Law of God, Deut. 22. verſes 20.21.</p>
            <p>And touching common whoredome, reade how that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, Leuit. 19.29. and Deut. 23.17.18.</p>
            <p>There are yet many other ſinnes which God forbiddeth in this Commaundement, as hath bene declared: Rehearſe you which they be.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:182:98"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord doth furthermore forbid in this his holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euery other kind of filthineſſe of the body; together with all outward prouocations and occaſions thereof: yea, and alſo euen the very inward conſent and luſt of the heart, after any kind of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and vncleaneneſſe of the fleſh whatſoeuer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three parts or branches of this your anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Lord (beſide the prohibition of the former ſinnes) forbiddeth all other filthineſſe of the body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he forbiddeth all outward prouocations and occaſions thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he forbiddeth the very vncleane luſt of the heart.</p>
            <p>In this order therefore let vs inquire of theſe things, that we may ſee the more fully, both into the excellent purity of this Law, which forbiddeth and condemneth all filthineſſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and alſo that we may the better know, what great cauſe we haue to be humbled before God, by reaſon of the moſt abominable filthineſſe which is in our nature, vntill we be waſhed and cleanſed from the ſame by the waſhing of our new birth in Chriſt Ieſus, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And firſt, which are thoſe other kinds of filthineſſe of the body, which the Lord doth moreouer and beſide all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, forbid in this his Commandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are either violent deflowring and rauiſhment, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of maide or maried vvife, young or old, vvhoſoeuer: and ſpecially all inceſtuous fornication and adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or elſe, they are thoſe abominable actions vvhich be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawfull vſe of nature, ſuch as are thoſe ſinnes, which may be vnderſtood by theſe three names, not once to be named, ſaue onely for neceſſary admonition and vvarning againſt them:</hi> Onans <hi>ſinne,</hi> Sodomitrie <hi>or</hi> buggery <hi>with men, and bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery with beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or laſt of all, when any worketh filthineſſe alone with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and is defiled in his body, by vnchast and filthy dreames, as a diuelliſh fruite thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are moſt abominable kinds of filthineſſe, euen ſuch as our hearts and eares ought to abhorre and tremble at whenſoeuer we thinke, or ſpeake, or heare any thing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:182:98"/> of them, though it be to the reproofe and condemnation of them.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe they are no other, then haue bene practiſed of men and women, young and old, of no worſe nature then we our ſelues are without the grace of God.</p>
            <p>O violent and that alſo inceſtuous rauiſhment we reade 2. Sam. 13.12.13.14.</p>
            <p>Of inceſtuous fornication and adultery we reade of the practiſe thereof, Geneſis chapter 19. verſe 31. &amp;c. and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 35.22. and 1. Corinthians chapter 5. verſe 1. Theſe ſinnes are forbidden Leuit. chap. 18. verſes 6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.</p>
            <p>Of Onans ſinne we reade Geneſis 38.9.</p>
            <p>Of the more abominable filthineſſe of the Sodomites or bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery with men, we reade Geneſis 19.5. &amp;c. And Iudges chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 19.23. and 1. Kings chapter 14. verſe 24. and chapter 15.12. and chapter 22.46. and 2 Kings 23.7. Ezek. 8.14. See the interpretation &amp; note of <hi>Tremel.</hi> Habbak chapter 2. verſes 15.16. Finally, Rom. chap. 1.24.26.17. This ſinne is forbidden Leuit. 18.22.</p>
            <p>Of the abominable filthineſſe of buggery with beaſts, we reade how the Lord hath forbidden it, Leuit 18. verſe 23. and 1. Tim. 1.10. And there haue bene ſome among our ſelues iuſtly executed for it. And wofull are the practiſes of many with their owne bodies, which God onely ſeeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and will certainely in his time take vengeance thereof, if it be not preuented by ſpeedy repentance.</p>
            <p>But alas, what ſhall we ſay? are children to heare of theſe things? and are they to be taught and warned thus plainely againſt them? No doubt, there is great need they ſhould: or elſe God would neuer haue mentioned them in his holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And ſhall the Diuell be ſuffered to draw both young and old into theſe ſinnes, and euen partly for want of knowlege, how odious and abhominable they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: and ſhall not we giue one another warning, that ſo great and groſſe wickedneſſe might bee preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:182:99"/>
            <p>The like is to be ſayd of other grieuous ſinnes.</p>
            <p>It is pity indeed that it ſhould be once heard off, that the ſonne ſhould kill the father, that the wife ſhould murther her husband, yea euen with her owne hands: that the husband ſhould breake his wiues necke, that any ſhould haue drowned or poyſoned themſelues. Yet ſeeing theſe ſins are committed of men and women among vs, ſhall they not be cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt from the word of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherefore children be ye admoniſhed, as well as you of the elder ſort, and take heed betimes to auoid all filthineſſe of your bodies: for if you will not call to God for grace and take heed betimes, it will aske you deepe heart-ſmart ere you dye, or elſe euerlaſting torment after death in hell fire: from the which I beſeech God of his infinite mercy, euen for Chriſt Ieſus ſake to bleſſe, preſerue and keepe vs both young and old, Amen.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the firſt branch of the former anſwer.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch followeth, wherein it was anſwered, that God forbiddeth not onely all theſe kinds of outward fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but alſo all outward prouocations and occaſions of all filthy luſt whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Shew what maner of prouocations and dangerous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe which follow, and if there be any other like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Houſes of open vvhoredome.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 <hi>All intemperancy in eating and drinking, eſpecially of ſuch things as any know to be more mighty then other, to prouoke and increaſe luſt: as alſo the prouoking of others to eate of ſuch things, and to drinke vnto drunkenneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="4">4 <hi>Ouer much ſleepe and idleneſſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of all theſe euill prouocations, we haue earneſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning giuen vs, as you haue heard, out of the word of God: and they are ſuch things as both men and women are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of.</p>
            <p>There are other prouocations more particularly to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of women.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>All light and curious ſetting out of themſelues, in brauery of apparell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>All exceſſiue perfuming of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>All immodeſt broiding, curling, and laying out of the haire: yea of ſtrange haire, with like laying forth of their breaſts naked and bare.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, all vvhatſoeuer agreeth not with ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſty of behauiour, which is the chiefe outward ornament of that ſexe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe things alſo you haue heard how the word of God giueth vs like earneſt warning.</p>
            <p>Thus much therefore of the ſecond branch of that your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anſwer.</p>
            <p>The third branch is yet behind, wherein you ſaid, that beſide all theſe outward prouocations to vncleane and filthy luſt, God doth in this Commandement forbid the very vncleane and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſt of the heart it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of this?</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:182:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 5. <hi>chapter of Mathevv our Sauiour Chriſt plainely affirmeth, that whoſoeuer looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. And chapter</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>The very adulterous thought doth defile a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of our Sauiour Chriſt are very plaine indeed to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Lord forbiddeth ſo many, and thoſe ſo groſſe and abhominable kinds of filthineſſe of the fleſh: Why doth he vnder the name of adultery comprehend them all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe howſoeuer all filthineſſe againſt nature, as alſo all violent rauiſhment and inceſt conſidered in the act it ſelfe, or moſt vile maner thereof, are more hainous then adultery: yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of diuerſe weighty reaſons and circumſtances, the Lord hath thought good to make mention of adultery, as of the greateſt and moſt grieuous ſinne among them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can you ſhew which thoſe reaſons and circumſtances are?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe of that high eſtimation which the Lord God hath of the mariage couenant, which by adultery is moſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken and diſhonoured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe euen they that are wickedly bent to follovv their lust, do more eaſily and more vſually imbolden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to this ſinne (if they ſee how they may attaine vnto it) then vnto rauiſhment and inceſt, or vnto thoſe ſinnes which are againſt the vſe of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe this ſinne hath in their conceipt, a more cleanely and ſafe couert, to conceale and hide it ſelfe from the eyes of men, then any of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, becauſe more perſons are more deepely iniured and damnified by the committing of this ſinne, then of any of the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of theſe things is eaſily diſcerned.</p>
            <p>But now at the laſt, leauing theſe filthy ſinnes of the fleſh, which cannot but be odious to all honeſt and chaſt hearts, and euen an humbling vnto vs all, to be detained in the thought of them, and to heare and conſider of the

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord our God commaundeth euery one of vs, both in ſingle life, and in the maried eſtate, from the firſt of our yeares, to the laſt of our dayes, to poſſeſſe our veſſels, that is, our bodies, in holineſſe and honour: and that to the ſame ende, vve labour after all thoſe graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and vſe all thoſe good meanes and helpes in the practiſe of the ſame vertues, vvhich be meete and neceſſarie thereunto.</hi>

            <p>Which are the vertues of the firſt ſort, and the meanes and helpes thereunto, ſuch as belong to all, both maried and vnmaried, yong and old, euen from the firſt time that we come to any diſcretion, to the end of our liues?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe foure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt chaſtity, vvhich is an vndefiled cleaneneſſe of the mind, ſuppreſſing and keeping vnder all inordinate lust of the bodie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly ſhamefastneſſe, vvhich is as the nource of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, vvhen the heart being as it vvere ſtricken and rebuked in it ſelfe, the face bluſheth, ſo ſoone as vve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their thinke or heare, or behold (though at vnawares) any vncleanely and vnſhamefaſt ſpeech or action.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:182:101"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly temperance, which is as the bridle of bodily luſt, in that it vtterly abſteineth from all vnlawfull pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly ſobriety, which is as one may ſay, the beauty and perfection of temperance, conſiſting in the moderation of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures and delights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And finally (as meanes and helpes to all theſe vertues) earneſt prayer, and the ſame alſo ſometimes ioyned with the holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of priuate humiliation and faſting: and alwayes diligent exerciſe in ſome honeſt buſineſſe or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe vertues, with the meanes and helpes thereof, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed common to all both young and old, one and other, Concerning the which alſo, we are not onely to be carefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to practiſe them himſelfe, but all ſtand further more bound, as much as lyeth in euery of vs, to cheriſh them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ſuppreſſe the contrary. And ſpecially ſuch as haue gouernement ſtand bound to looke vnto it, concerning all that belong to them, Tit. 2.1.2.3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But as was ſayd, there are other vertues and duties, which do more particularly belong to the maried, and that alſo part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for comfortable entrance into it, and partly for happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance therein.</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe that appertaine to comfortable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the maried eſtate, in way of preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that the parties intending mariage, do in their hearts acknowledge it to be the holy and honourable ordinance of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that they haue ſuch gifts as do of right belong to the maried eſtate: ſuch as are, ſome skill and honeſt trade to get their liuing vvith the labour and exerciſe thereof, as alſo wiſedome for the religious ordering and gouerning of a family; with a mind prepared to indure, and chearefully to paſſe through the manifold troubles vvhich are mixed vvith the comforts of that condition of life.</hi>

               <hi>Thirdly, that they ſeeke their yoake-fellow by hearty prayer to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that they ſeeke the counſell and conſent of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:182:101"/> or for want of naturall parents, the counſell of ſuch as are in ſtead of parents vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, that after all due aduice and free conſent obtained, &amp; their owne hearts firmely vnited betwixt themſelues, they ſeeke thenceforth to be religiouſly contracted and eſpouſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that they deferre to come together as man and wife, till their mariage be publikely and in lawfull maner ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and bleſſed in the Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the graces &amp; vertues to be obſerued, for the right maner of comfortable entrance into the maried eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now which are they which be neceſſarie for happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe which follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that the promiſe and faith of the mariage couenant be entirely and conſtantly kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that mutuall loue and beneuolence be alwayes on both parts, wiſely and ſoberly cheriſhed and maintained, aſwell in aduerſitie as proſperitie, with a fellow-feeling each of others ioy or griefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that long and vnneceſſarie abſence or ſeparation be auoyded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that, as they be one fleſh, ſo alſo they be of one ſpirit, conſenting in all good things, and ſpecially in the ſpirituall duties of Gods holy ſeruice and worſhip; and euen for the ſame cauſe, in bodily abstinence it ſelfe, ſo often and ſo long as the word of God, and partly the verie courſe which God hath ſet in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſheweth that it is conuenient and meete they ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are all bound vpon the due obſeruation of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules and cautions, to ſeeke mariage by the charge of this Commaundement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſoeuer haue not a ſpeciall gift from God, to liue purely &amp; chaſtly without mariage, they are all bound to ſeeke it, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in their owne hearts they would choſe rather, or had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie raſhly vowed to liue a ſingle life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but it is ſo: according to the Apoſtles rule, 1. Cor. 7.2. To auoide fornication, let euerie man haue his wife, and let euerie woman haue her owne husband. And
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:182:102"/> againe verſe 9. It is better to marrie then to burne.</p>
            <p>And then conſequently, it muſt needes be much better to marrie, and ſo to auoide the burning heat of luſt, then by ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mariage, to fall into thoſe filthie practiſes which are worſe then fornication, as many do, according to that which hath bene declared before.</p>
            <p>They alſo do very wickedly againſt this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, who ſoeuer ſtanding in need of Gods ordinance, do ſhun it becauſe of the trouble and charges of it, which grow by increaſe of children, &amp;c. For they, therein plainely bewray againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are without true conſcience and remorſe of ſinne, and that they are alſo voide of faith in Gods fatherly prouidence &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo, as againe we are to remember, that mariage muſt not be raſhly and inordinately haſted before the time.</p>
            <p>But now, as touching thoſe few, which haue the gift to liue chaſtly in ſingle life; is it in no wiſe lawfull for them to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are not forbidden to marrie. Neuertheleſſe, when God hath giuen the gift, and ſo long as it pleaſeth him to continue it; they that haue receiued it ſhall do best, who will haue care to vſe it in their ſingle eſtate, ſo long as they may bring moſt glorie to God, by their abstayning from ſeeking a wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: and ſo are the words of our Sauiour Chriſt Mat. chapter 19. concerning this matter to be vnderſtood, where he ſaith, verſe 12. in the end of the verſe: He that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this, let him receiue it. And ſo alſo is the Apoſtle Paul to be vnderſtood, in his whole diſputation about the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1. Cor. the 7. chapter.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the interpretation of this ſeuenth Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both touching the euils forbidden, and alſo concerning the vertues and good duties commaunded.</p>
            <p>The equitie of it commeth now to be conſidered: Shew you therefore, what the equitie of it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The equitie of this Commaundement may be conſidered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe vvayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in respect of God the author and giuer of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:182:102"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in reſpect of euerie one to whom it is giuen apart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Equitie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, in reſpect of the Church and common wealth of God, more generally and ioyntly conſidered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, in reſpect of God himſelfe, what is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe God our heauenly Law-giuer, is in himſelfe moſt pure and holy, therefore it is moſt meet, that he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his people all vncleaneneſſe; and on the contrarie, commaund all puritie and cleaneneſſe both of ſoule and body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in ſo much as the continuall propagation &amp; increaſe of mankind, as vvell as their firſt creation is belonging vnto God, it is likevviſe very meete, that he ſhould appoynt the vvay and meanes of the ſame increaſe, and not that it ſhould be left to mans owne wandring and inordinate lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, becauſe he hath ſanctified and appoynted mariage, for a moſt gracious and comfortable remedie against all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, becauſe he hath adopted our bodies aſwell as our ſoules, to be the temples of his holy Spirit, and members of the myſticall bodie of our Sauiour Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, ſeeing all lawfull promiſes, couenants, and bargains, are to be performed, yea thought it be to a mans hinderance, as vve reade in the</hi> 15. <hi>Pſalme, it is much rather euerie vvay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and meete, that the couenant of mariage, be eſpecially regarded, ſeeing (aboue all other humane contractes) this is honoured vvith the title of the Couenaunt of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus therefore in reſpect of God, we ſee how great the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of this Commaundement is.</p>
            <p>What is the equitie of it, in regard of our ſelues more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſidered?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ariſeth from the former ground: for in ſo much as God hath aduanced vs to eſpeciall dignitie, aboue all brute beaſtes, and euerie kind of his vnreaſonable creatures, it is meete that euerie of vs ſhould ſeeke the increaſe and propagation of our ovvne kind and generation, in a more holy and honourable manner and vvay then anie of them do: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:182:103"/> both in mariage and out of mariage, to poſſeſſe our bodies in more holineſſe and honour then they do, according to that which hath bene anſwered before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further alſo, becauſe the ſinne of bodily vncleaneneſſe, bringing a ſpeciall reproch vpon the perſon of euerie offender, as that which a man committeth more directly againſt himſelfe then anie other ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeede doth the Apoſtle Paule reaſon in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged, 1. Cor. 6. verſe 18. Fly fornication; euerie ſinne that a man committeth is without the bodie, but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth fornication ſinneth againſt his owne bodie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs reaſon here againe, as the Apoſtle hath taught vs in the 15. verſe of the ſame chapter: Shall I then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. As though he ſhould ſay, Fic vpon that. And much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, let vs reaſon: ſhall I take the members of Chriſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any ſin of inceſt, or rauiſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or againſt the law &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe of nature? God forbid. Yea with moſt deepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt all ſuch abominable ſinnes, let vs ſay againe, and againe, and the Lord giue vs grace to ſay in truth of heart, God forbid. Farre be it from anie of vs once to thinke to do ſo. The very brute beaſtes would then condemne vs, for they ſhew themſelues more orderly then ſo.</p>
            <p>Now, what is the equitie of this pure and holy Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in reſpect of the common wealth and Church of God, more generally and publikely conſidered?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe by fornication and adulterie, they are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the mixture of a baſe and curſed poſteritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe the right of inheritance is thereby many times wofully interrupted, ſpecially in the baſe diſcent of noble men and Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, becauſe by the wicked and bold example euen of a few, ſpecially if they be of high place and calling, many are eaſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to commit much filthineſſe, till the whole land be filled with adulteries, as the Prophet Ieremie complaineth in the</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>verſes of the</hi> 23. <hi>chapter of his propheſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby, as the ſame Prophet in diuerſe other places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, the iudgements of God were haſtened againſt the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:182:103"/> land:<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note> for becauſe of adulteries and others (as he ſaith in the ſame chapter) the land mourned, and the pleaſant places of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe were dryed vp, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore we haue a fit occaſion to come to inquire of the curſes and puniſhments, which God in his iuſtice threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt the tranſgreſsions of this his ſo equall and pure a Law.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what is the curſe againſt adulterie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The curſe is manifold, according to the manifold treſpaſſe of this ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs conſider diligently of them: rehearſe you as ſhortly as you can, which they be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ciuill courſe of Gods iuſtice, commaunded and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among his people Iſraell, it was bodily death if it came forth to light. Yea euen among all heathen people and nations, God prouideth that this ſinne hath bene vſually puniſhed, either with death, or ſome other very grieuous and ſharpe puniſhment, to the ſingular reproch of the offenders in the midſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas this ſinne of adulterie is oftentimes kept ſecret, from the knowledge and ſentence of the earthly iudge, it meeteth notwithſtanding with ſundrie curſes from the diuine iuſtice and vengeance of God, ſuch as are, either barrenneſſe of the wombe, or curſed of-ſpring, or monstrous conceptions, or with ſome one grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous bodily diſeaſe or other: and namely with that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the French pockes, which vſually waiteth vpon it. Yea it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vvith a generall waſting, both of the vvhole bodily and worldly ſubſtance, and vvith an vntimely and wretched death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, no adulterer ſhall inherite the kingdome of God, but they ſhall haue their portion together in that lake which burneth vvith fire and brimſtone for euer in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That temporall death is the puniſhment of adulterie by the ciuill ordinance of God, reade Leuit. 20.10. and Deut. 22.22. And for the practiſe of other nations, reade Geneſ. 26.10.11. and chap. 39. and Ezek. chap. 16.36. &amp;c. and chapter 23.10. and Ierem. 29.22.23.</p>
            <p>Concerning other puniſhments and curſes from the hand of God, we reade oftentimes in the Prouerbs, and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:182:104"/>
            <p>Finally, touching euerlaſting deſtruction both of bodie and ſoule, 1. Cor. 1.6.9. Reuel. 21.8. and chap. 22.15. Hebr. 13.4.</p>
            <p>The ſame eternall deſtruction, belongeth alſo to the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, and to thoſe that commit the ſinnes againſt nature as in the ſame place of the Apoſtle to the Corinthians.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The lawes alſo of our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreable to the Law of God, do puniſh buggerie and rauiſhment by death. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo by our law, the carnall knowledge of any woman-child vnder ten yeares of age, is fellonie, and ſo death to him that defloureth her, though the child ſhould giue conſent.</note>And likewiſe alſo, God hath commaunded all thoſe abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſinnes to be puniſhed with temporall death, in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill courſe of iuſtice among his people, as appeareth in the 20. chapter of Leuiticus, and in diuerſe other places. Geneſ. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 28. reade how God by his owne hand puniſhed Onans ſinne. The like indignation he beareth againſt all ſelfe defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, God commaundeth the fornication of the maid found with child by another after mariage; as alſo the fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eſpouſed perſon, to be puniſhed by death, Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy 22.20. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus conſidered, let vs now go forward.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe of God againſt the tranſgreſſion of the law of mariage, by taking more wiues the none, which is alſo a ſinne againſt this Commandement, as hath bene ſhewed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is no doubt in it ſelfe, without the mercie of God, a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinne, ſeeing it is a kind of adulterie; and God hath from the beginning alwayes puniſhed it with much diſquietneſſe, and vexations in the families vvhere it hath bene entertained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade Geneſis 4.23.24. Yea we may ſee it in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Abraham, and of Iaakob, Geneſis chapter 16. and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 29. and chapter 30. And alſo 1. Samuel 1. Contrariwiſe Iſaak liued a more ſweete and comfortable life with his onely wife Rebecca, for that he kept both himſelfe and his loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire vnto her. Geneſ. 24.67.</p>
            <p>Now, which is the curſe againſt fornication committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſingle perſons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albeit the Lord doth not iudge it with ſo heauie a temporall puniſhment as he doth adulterie; yet he ſhutteth the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator aſwell as the adulterer, yea, the vvanton bodie alſo, and filthie talker, out of his heauenly kingdome,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>and Epheſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:182:104"/>
            <p>So indeede we reade it plainely expreſſed in thoſe places. And concerning temporall puniſhment, reade Exodus 22.16.17. and Deuteronomy 22.28.29. Leuiticus chapter, 19.20.21.22. it is ſuch, as when it was in practiſe did ſufficiently fray all well diſpoſed perſons from this ſinne, beſide the feare of the eternall puniſhment of hell.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt intemperance in eating and drinking?</p>

            <p>Reade alſo Iſa. 5.11.12.13.14. The curſes of this ſinne are baniſhment and famine in this life, and euerlaſting deſtruction in hell. Reade alſo verſe 22. And likewiſe Amos 6. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt the curious pride, &amp; wanton nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of women in apparell, with immodeſt curling and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the haire, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 3. <hi>chapter of the Prophecie of Iſaiah, verſe</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;c. The Lord ſaith he vvill make the heads of ſuch bald, and that he vvill diſcouer their ſecret parts: he vvill take avvay all their ornaments, wherein they delight and pride themſelues. And in ſteade of ſvveete ſauour (ſaith the Lord by his holy Prophet) there ſhall be ſtinke, and in ſteade of a girdle a rent, and in ſteade of dreſſing of the haire baldneſſe, and in ſteade of a ſtomacher a girding of ſackecloth, and burning in ſteade of beautie. Finally, the ſvvord, famine, miſerie, and all outvvard ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the curſe of vaine and proud women.</p>
            <pb n="198" facs="tcp:182:105"/>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt the vanitie and pride of men in the ſame abuſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Propheſie of Zephaniah, chap.</hi> 1.18. <hi>In the day of the Lords ſacrifice (as ſaith the Prophet) he vvill viſite the princes, and the kings children, and all ſuch as are clothed vvith ſtrange apparell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to ſay, ſuch as are full of the maners and faſhions of other nations, Iſa. 2.6.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe of adulterous thoughts and motions, if they be in the leaſt meaſure conſented vnto?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The curſe and puniſhment of them is hell fire. Mat.</hi> 5.29.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And beſides, all they that ſtriue not againſt thoughts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto vncleaneneſſe, do at one time or other fall into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of vncleaneneſſe themſelues: and ſo all the former curſes alreadie rehearſed, take hold of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We haue ſeene it before in the example of king Dauid: and therefore it is that he prayeth ſo earneſtly: Create in me a cleane heart ô God, &amp;c. Pſalm. 51.</p>
            <p>Daily experience confirmeth the truth of it. Wherefore, it moſt vrgently ſtandeth vs vpon, to hearken to the admonition of our Sauiour Chriſt: If thy right eye cauſe thee to offend, plucke it out and caſt it from thee: for it is better for thee that one of thy members periſh, then that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell.</p>
            <p>Finally, what is the curſe of thoſe that are ſo farre from care to further chaſtitie and temperance in others, and to ſtay the courſe of their vncleanely conuerſation, that they willingly ſuffer themſelues to be drawne into fellowſhip with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 50. <hi>Pſalme verſe</hi> 18. <hi>and</hi> 22. <hi>The Lord threateneth destruction, yea ſo as none ſhall be able to reſcue and deliuer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe then are the curſes and plagues, which in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement of God belong to the tranſgreſsions of this holy &amp; pure commandement of God. Euerie kind of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is abominable in his ſight. Fornication doth greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his anger. Adulterie doth ſet it on fire. Inceſt cauſeth it to breake foorth into a flame. The ſinnes againſt nature draw downe fire and brimſtone to conſume all from heauen.</p>
            <p>The bleſsings follow: and they are either ſuch as do more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:182:105"/> and ioyntly belong to chaſtitie,<note place="margin">The Bleſſings.</note> both in ſingle life and in the maried eſtate: or elſe they are ſuch as belong partly to chaſtitie in ſingle life, and partly to chaſtitie and faithfulneſſe in the mariage couenant.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, which are the ioynt bleſſings of all that liue chaſtly, temperately and ſoberly, aſwell in the one eſtate as in the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a great bleſſing to either ſort, that they are preſerued, &amp; ſet free from the former curſes both of ſoule and bodie, of life, goods and name, the which the Lord threateneth againſt all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast, intemperate and wanton perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But their bleſſing is yet greater, in that they may with the vnſpeakeable comfort and peace of a good conſcience, looke for the bleſſed appearance of our Sauiour Chriſt, to their eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation at the day of the laſt iudgement, Titus, chapter</hi> 2. <hi>verſes</hi> 11.12.13. <hi>And Matthevv chapter</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure inheart (ſaith our Sauiour himſelfe) for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He meaneth that all ſuch ſhall ſee him to their vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, and enioy the happineſſe of his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Ezek. 18.6.9.</p>
            <p>But let vs more particularly conſider of the bleſſing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to chaſtitie in either eſtate of life.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what proofe haue you concerning the bleſſing of thoſe that liue chaſtly in ſingle life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may behold it in the example of Ioſeph, whom God not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered from the falſe ſlaunder of his Lady or miſtreſſe this vvay; but alſo, he turned it to be a meanes of his aduauncement to a higher degree of vvorldly honour, for the ſingular benefite of the Church of God, Geneſis chapter</hi> 39. <hi>and chapter</hi> 41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may ſee it alſo in that law of Moſes, vvherein God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly prouideth by an ordinarie courſe of iustice, for the defence of the mayde falſely accuſed of diſhoneſtie, Deuteronomy chapt.</hi> 22. <hi>verſes</hi> 18.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, concerning the vnmaried, vvhether man or woman, mayde or vvidow, vvhoſoeuer haue ſo ſpeciall a gift of God, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:182:106"/> they can liue chastly without the helpe of mariage, vvhich hath diuerſe incumbrances going vvith it; and if they haue care to vſe it to the right end, the Apostle Paule ſaith, that they are the more bleſſed in that reſpect, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God to continue that his gift &amp; bounteous grace vnto them,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth. chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>This point indeede is fully diſputed and determined in that Chapter: but with no preiudice againſt the maried eſtate, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as touching thoſe that haue not the gift to liue chaſt without it: Concerning the bleſsing of chaſtitie in ſingle life, reade verſes 1.7.8.25.26.27.35. and ſo forth to the end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>Now, what is the bleſsing of thoſe that liue chaſtly, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, purely and ſoberly in the maried eſtate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may perceiue it by that defence which God gaue vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and Sarah, Geneſis, chapter</hi> 20. <hi>and to Iſaac and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, Geneſ.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And alſo, in that he promiſeth to cleare the honeſt vvife falſly ſuſpected of diſhoneſtie by her iealous husband, as we reade in the fift chapter of the booke of Numbers, concerning the law of iealouſie, verſe</hi> 28. <hi>If the woman be not defiled (ſaith the Lord) but is cleane, ſhe ſhall be free from the curſe, and ſhe ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and beare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further, as the Apoſtle Paule teacheth, through bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of children, the wife continuing in faith, and loue, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe with modeſtie, ſhall be ſaued,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Apoſtle Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt. chapter</hi> 3. <hi>and verſe</hi> 7. <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that both Chriſtian husbands liuing with their vviues as men of knowledge, and their wiues alſo vvhich liue purely and truſt in God, are heires of the grace of life, promiſed to them in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea ſometime God ſheweth this ſpeciall mercie, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing wife, is a meanes of her vnbeleeuing husbands ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the beleeuing husband a meanes of the ſaluation of his vnbeleeuing wife,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Pſalme 128.1. &amp;c. and Pſalme 127.5. For as barrenneſſe is reckened for a curſe againſt the vncleaneneſſe of ſuch as haue defiled themſelus, as we reade Leuiticus, chapter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:182:106"/> 20. verſes 20.21. and ſometime euen for intended adulterie,<note place="margin">Euerie one of vs is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</note> as Geneſis 20, 17.18. ſo is fruitfulneſſe the bleſsing of a chaſt and ſober life in holy mariage. It is true indeed, that ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt women are barren for ſome other cauſes, as the Lord ſeeth meete, and it may be for the ſinne of the husband. It is true alſo, that ſome vncleane perſons, who liue vnchaſtly in mariage haue children, but that is to be accounted a bleſsing of God vpon the innocent partie, and not for the husbands or wiues cauſe, which ſoeuer of them be wicked and vnfaithfull to the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and if there be any ſuch like, they are the gracious bleſsings of God, vpon thoſe that ſhall obey this his holy and pure Commaundement.</p>
            <p>Hitherto therefore, of the whole interpretation &amp; doctrine of this ſeuenth Commaundement.</p>
            <p>The vſe is now laſt of all to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Haue you perfectly obeyed this holy Commaundement of God, in ſo pure and chaſt a life, both in thought, word and deede, that you may thinke your ſelfe worthie to eſcape the curſe, and fierce wrath of God, and to be partaker of the bleſsing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were a great ſinne in me, if I ſhould thinke ſo: for as I haue bene borne in ſinne, and conceiued in iniquitie: that is to ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as I am from the beginning, through the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſpoſed to all other ſin, ſo, and that alſo in a ſpeciall maner, am I inclining to the tranſgreſſion and diſobedience of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And as I grow in yeares, ſo I haue cauſe to feare that I ſhall increaſe in the breaking thereof, vnleſſe it ſhall pleaſe God to preſerue me from the ſame by his grace and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection: vvhich bleſſing I do humbly and hartely begge at his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercie, euen for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, bleſſe and preſerue you, and vs all from ſo great an euill. For that which you do confeſſe againſt your ſelfe (according as you are truely taught out of Gods holy word, that you ought to do, and namely from the fift verſe of the 51. Pſalme, where king Dauid by occaſion of his fall, maketh the ſame confeſsion
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:182:107"/> againſt himſelfe) the ſame is likewiſe to be acknowledged of euerie one of vs, though (as touching actuall tranſgreſſion) ſome haue offended more then other, according as we are el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in yeares, or haue bene more negligent in reſiſting the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement temptations of theſe ſinnes.</p>
            <p>For as the holy Prouerbe ſheweth, there is a growth in ſin, as there is a proceeding in yeares, if it be not by the grace of God, and by his bleſſing vpon good nurture and education repreſſed and driuen away. Reade Prouerbs chap. 29.15.16.17. and chap. 22.15.</p>
            <p>And how eaſily children will learne filthie words and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, if they heare and ſee them in others, euerie one can tell that knoweth any thing: whereby it is euident that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we are all greatly inclined this way.</p>
            <p>So that, vnleſſe our Sauiour Chriſt had ſatisfied the iuſtice of God, that is to ſay, vnleſſe his bloud had bene ſhed, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that water and bloud which ranne from his very heart, to waſh away this filthineſſe of our nature, and all the euill and vncleane fruites thereof: and if he had not alſo in his owne life, fulfilled the righteouſneſſe and obedience of this Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for vs, as well as the reſt of the Commaundements of God, this alone would condemne vs to the verie bottomleſſe pit of hell, for a iuſt reward of our tranſgreſsions againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>Againſt the which damnation therefore, that our faith may be comforted and eſtabliſhed in this point; I meane the faith of ſo many as ſhall truely repent of their ſinnes, and labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pureneſſe of life; let vs to our comfort earneſtly conſider of the perfect obedience which our Sauiour Chriſt hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto it on our behalfe.</p>
            <p>VVhat proofe haue you of this part of his perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Although our Sauiour Christ, (being in all things like vnto vs, ſinne onely excepted) had an aptneſſe in nature to know vvhat belongeth to the deſire of mariage, ſo farre as he might knovv it in the puritie of mans nature vvithout ſinne, yet he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a moſt chaſt, temperate and ſober life, in the vnmaried e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:182:107"/> as it is euident by that vvhich is teſtified in the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, of his most pure conuerſation tovvard all,<note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obedience for vs.</note> both men and vvomen, and of his effectuall reprouing of the ſinnes of bodily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe, ſo that many harlots vvere conuerted and brought to repentance by his moſt holy and pure doctrine, not onely in publike ſermon, but alſo in priuate ſpeech, according to euery iuſt occaſion. Such as vvas the vvoman of Samaria, of vvhom vve reade in the fourth chapter of the Goſpell of the Euangeliſt Iohn, and that other ſinfull vvoman, vvho vvaſhed the feete of our Sauiour Chriſt vvith the teares of her repentaunce, and vviped them vvith the haires of her heade, Luke chapt.</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 37. <hi>and ſo forth to the end of the chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the perfect obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Commaundement is yet further confirmed, in that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he liued all his dayes in the vnmaried eſtate (he vſing his moſt perfect gift of chaſtitie vvithout mariage, as vvas euerie vvay moſt meete for him, both in reſpect of his diuine perſon, he being both God and man, and alſo in reſpect of his moſt holy office and calling) yet he by all meanes honoured mariage, as the holy ordinance, the diuine gift and grace of God, both by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and alſo by miracle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For (as vve reade in the ſecond chapter of Iohn) he wrought his firſt miracle at a mariage feaſt, he there turning vvater into vvine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Matthevv chapter</hi> 19. <hi>vvhere he reproueth the abuſe of vnlavvfull diuorcements, vvhich vvere againſt the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the mariage couenant: vve reade hovv he calleth all backe to the firſt inſtitution of God, in the beginning of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, for the reformation of euerie abuſe againſt it: and for the reſtoring of mariage to the firſt and moſt honourable dignitie of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for the ſame cauſe alſo it is, that he vvas ſo vehement and ſeuere againſt adulterie, yea euen against the vnchaſt looke of the eye, and againſt the verie luſt of the heart, as hath bene anſvvered before out of the fift chapter of the ſame Goſpell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. Matthevv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things duely conſidered, do ſufficiently confirme the perfect obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:182:108"/>
            <p>Thus then, if we beleeue in our Sauiour Chriſt, and if by ſaith we apprehend in him both our redemption through his bloud, for our tranſgreſsions againſt this Commaunnement, and alſo our iuſtification by his perfect obedience, and the imputation therof vnto vs through Gods moſt free and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous grace; and if we ſhall labour after a temperate and ſober life, we may then comfortably perſwade our ſelues, that we ſhall eſcape euerie curſe, and be partakers of all bleſsing and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>But what particular proofe haue you that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the tranſgreſsions of this Commandement, yea the moſt hainous of them, to all ſuch as ſhall truely repent thereof, and beleeue in the name of our Sauiour Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 21. <hi>chapter of Matthew, verſes</hi> 31.32. <hi>our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, that Publicanes and harlots beleeuing and repenting, ſhall go into the kingdome of God, and enioy the euerlaſting crowne of happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, he ſaith, they ſhall go into his kingdome before ſuch, as in compariſon of them, ſeeme to themſelues righteous, and therefore regard not to beleeue, neither are moued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>What proofe elſe haue you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle Paule,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 6. <hi>hauing made mention of fornicators, adulterers, wantons, buggerers, ſaith that ſuch were ſome of the Corinthians before their conuerſion by the preaching of the Goſpell: but now (ſaith the Apoſtle) ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O moſt gracious and wonderfull riches of Gods free grace and bounteous mercie in our Sauiour Chriſt! what bleſsing, and praiſe and honour, and thankes, may we render vnto his maieſtie for ſo vnſpeakeable a grace.</p>
            <p>But is not this the way to make ſinners the more bold to commit theſe ſinnes, by ſuch preaching of the forgiueneſſe of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not, ſo long as repentance is preached as well as forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:182:108"/>
            <p>It is very true: for all they that haue grace to repent,<note place="margin">The Equitie.</note> (to whom onely forgiueneſſe doth belong) the more and greater ſinnes they vnderſtand by the Goſpell to be forgiuen them through the riches of Gods mercie in Chriſt, the more do they loue God and Chriſt their Sauiour, and the more do they hate their ſinne, and the more carefull they are to pleaſe God for euer after, according to that which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith of the ſinfull woman, Luke chapter 7.47. Manie ſinnes are forgiuen her, that is, ſhe hath comfortable perſwaſion thereof in her heart by faith: and therefore as our Sauiour Chriſt argueth from thence, ſhe loued verie much. And ſo no doubt do all they that haue the like perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>We muſt alwaies remember the words of our Sauiour Chriſt: Go and ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing come vnto thee. Iohn 5.14.</p>
            <p>And thus is the repentance of Iudah noted, touching his inceſtuous adultery with his daughter in law, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his ſinne and lay with her no more, Geneſis chapt. 38. verſe 26.</p>
            <p>The like are we to thinke of Lot, Noah, Dauid, and of the inceſtuous Corinthians, that they ſinned no more in ſuch ſort as they had ſinned before their true repentance, concerning their ſpeciall ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer do not thus in the like caſes, they can haue no true comfort, that their ſinnes are forgiuen them, but ſhall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly deceiue themſelues, to the euerlaſting deſtruction of their ſoules.</p>
            <p>And thus are we now (by the gracious bleſsing of God) come to the eight Commaundement.</p>
            <p>What is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi>

            <p>The Lord hauing in the ſixt Commaundement prouided for the ſafegard of mans perſon and life, and in the ſeuenth for the propagation of the life of mankind, leaſt the earth ſhold be left void of a poſteritie lawfully deſcending: it followeth now fitly in the eight Commandement, that the Lord ſhould take order concerning the outward commodities of his life, for the comfortable maintenance thereof.</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:182:109"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sins forbidden.</note>But that we may attaine to the vnderſtanding of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, let vs inquire of it in our former order from point to point.</p>
            <p>And firſt, concerning the negatiue part.</p>
            <p>What doth almightie God forbid vnder this word ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnder this word ſtealing, almightie God comprehendeth and forbiddeth all iniustice vvhatſoeuer may be committed of any perſon, young or old, in any matter or interpriſe litle or great, touching the goods and outvvard commodities of this life, vvhether the ſame iniuſtice ſhould be compaſſed and brought to paſſe by force and violence, againſt the vvill of the right ovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by any kind of ſubtiltie and fraud, vvithout his knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby then, it appeareth that the propertie of euerie mans right and poſſeſſion, and all diſtinction of mine and thine which is in the world, is of the hand of God; and that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident diſtribution is the ground and foundation of all iuſtice, to be obſerued in nations betwixt people and people, and in all ſocieties betwixt euerie man and his neighbour, according to that poſitiue law, which the Lord hath ſet, Deuteronomy. 19. chapter 14. Thou ſhalt not remoue thy neighbors marke, which they of old time and antiquitie haue ſet in thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And Prouerbes 22.28. and chapter 23.10.11.</p>
            <p>This law indeed did ſpecially reſpect the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell: neuertheleſſe it is euident alſo by the holy Scriptures, that God hath diſtributed the whole world according to the pleaſure of his owne will, Geneſis chapter 10. and chapter 11.8. and Deuteronomy 32.8. &amp;c. Reade alſo Pſalme 8. and Pſalme 24. and Pſalme 50.10. &amp;c. and Pſalm. 95.4.5. and 115.16.</p>
            <p>But many get that which they hold, by no honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, but by wicked practiſes, and that partly by force, and partly by deceit, as hath bene anſwered before: What is to be ſaid to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hovvſoeuer it be, that any hold goods and poſſeſſions, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by right or by vvrong, it is iniustice for any liuing in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:182:109"/> a ſetled common-wealth, to ſteale the leaſt thing from them, or to vſe any vnlawfull force, yea, though they be ſuch as haue iuſt right thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is to be done then?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Onely lawfull meanes muſt be vſed for the righting of all vvrongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it ought to be indeed: One euill muſt not be remedied by another: for that would make the euill worſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate is appointed of God to heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſuch caſes. To them therefore muſt all that be wronged reſort and ſeeke for iudgement, Exod. 22.7. &amp;c. and Deut. 17.8. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what if all lawfull meanes faile, and that the Iudge will not do his office in the execution of iuſtice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The matter muſt then be peaceably left to the righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God verily muſt be the onely refuge in ſuch extremities: and we may well comfort our ſelues in him, that he will in due ſeaſon righteouſly iudge both the iuſt and the wicked. Reade Eccleſ. 3.16.17.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to inquire of the particular ſinnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this Commandement is tranſgreſſed and broken.</p>
            <p>The which, as I ſuppoſe, we may not vnfitly do in this order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if we ſearch out the ſinnes of ſuch as be in authority ouer the reſt: and Secondly, what are the ſinnes of thoſe that be vnder their gouernement.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore in the firſt place, which be the ſinnes of thoſe in authority, whether they be tyrants or lawfull gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: for euen the one as well as the other, may be theeues and robbers in the ſight of God, and by the verdict of this his Commandement, Reade Iob 12.5.6. Pſalme 62.10. Iſaiah 1.23. Hoſh 6.9. and chap. 7.1.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore (I ſay) which their ſinnes of iniuſtice be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrants vvith their Lieutenants, Captaines, and ſouldiers, yea, and all other ſoueraigne Kings and Princes ſinne againſt this Commandement of Almighty God, the Kings of Kings, and Prince of all Princes; when by vniuſt warres they inuade the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:182:110"/> lands and dominions of other Princes, and ſpoile their ſubiects of their goods, either by piracy vpon the ſeas, or by robbing and ſtealing vpon the land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſame againe, both tyrants, and alſo all lawfull Kings and Princes, with their Iudges and vnder officers, do then likewiſe breake this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, in time of peace among their owne ſubiects, when of malice, or for loue of corrupting bribes &amp; gifts, they either vtterly peruert, or in any point corrupt true iudgement; &amp; alſo when they delay and hinder the ſpeedy courſe thereof, ſpecially touching the pitifull cauſe of the ſtranger and the poore, the widow and the fatherleſſe: and finally, vvhen they lay burthenſome exactions vpon their ſubiects, without iuſt and waighty cauſes, and when they conſume the common treaſury v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their priuate and pompous luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſinnes of Princes and Rulers are euery where mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried out againſt by the Prophets of God, in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now, what are the ſinnes of thoſe that liue together in more equall eſtate and condition of life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are very many of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for beſide ſecret ſtealing and open robbing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among men, iniuſtice may be committed both in regard of other mens goods and commodities, and alſo in regard of their owne: and that alſo diuerſe wayes, in either reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, which are the wayes whereby iniuſtice may be committed in reſpect of other mens goods and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, when we do negligently, but much rather if vve ſhould vvilfully damnifie or hinder them in any matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, when vve do any way get out of their hands any part of that vvhich we haue no right vnto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, when we detaine or keepe in our owne hands any part of that which belongeth vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But moſt of all, when any do vtterly alienate the title of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance from the right heire thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the firſt of theſe points of iniuſtice, we haue two inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giuen vnto vs: the one of wilfulneſſe, the other of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Exod. 22. verſes 5.6.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:182:110"/>
            <p>Let vs come to the ſecond point.</p>
            <p>How may iniuſtice be committed in getting other mens goods out of their hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This may be practiſed many wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew how.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In buying or ſelling, letting or hiring, borowing or lending, paying wages, or doing of worke, in exchange of commodities, in partnerſhip, or in any other lawfull kind of contracting and dealing betwixt man and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But much more when any get them by dice-play, or any other cogging and couſening practiſes, as we call them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt of all, by crafty lawing and bribing, to the peruerting of right from the holy ſeate of iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs briefly run theſe things ouer.</p>
            <p>And firſt, how may iniuſtice be practiſed in buying?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the buyer huckleth with the ſeller, and diſpraiſeth his ware aboue that there is cauſe, and vnder pretence of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thereof, vvill not giue to the worth of it, becauſe he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that his neighbour hath great need to ſell. Or, when any pretending to be vvilling to giue to the vvorth, maketh payment vvith counterfeit and falſe coine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This corruption the Spirit of God noteth to the reproofe of it, Prou. chap. 20.14. And in the next verſe he commendeth the contrary courſe, that is, when men vſing good diſcretion, put away ſuch fained colluſions.</p>
            <p>Shew likewiſe how iniuſtice is committed by the ſeller.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he ouerpriſeth his vvare, and will not content himſelfe with a reaſonable gaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he ſelleth the ſecond, praiſing it for the beſt, and that vvhich is mixed and ſoily, for that vvhich is pure and good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or though he do not ſo, yet if he vſe falſe vvaights, or skant meaſure, or vntrue tale, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo, vvhen any ſell lands or houſes, vnder a falſe title, or by falſe and forged euidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or ſurfeted cattell for ſound of limme and wind: or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like euill practiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:182:111"/>
            <p>It is very true: for in theſe caſes the Law, or rather the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious outrule of the ſeller, <hi>Caueat emptor,</hi> Let the buier take heed, it is corrupt and naught: The heathen haue repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this kind of dealing, and much more is it condemned in the word of God, reade Leuit. 19.35.36. and Deut. 25.13.14.15.16. Prou. 11.1. and 1. Theſ. 4.6. and in many other places. The rule which God giueth for buying and ſelling is this; When thou ſelleſt ought to thy neighbour, or buyeſt at thy neighbours hand, ye ſhall not oppreſſe one another, Leuit. 25.14. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We ought therefore to buy and ſell ſo, as it might be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by our dealings, that our hearts are not poſſeſſed with ſelfe-loue and couetouſneſſe, &amp;c. but that euen in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dealings we haue the feare of God before our eyes, and louing hearts toward our brethren. And ſo alſo ought it to be in letting and lending, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let vs go forward.</p>
            <p>How is iniuſtice committed in letting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When land-lords do ſo improue the fines and rents of their houſes and farmes, that their poore farmers and tenants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue comfortably in them by the fruite of their labour, and by the employing of their cattell, but rather waſte their ſtocke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame. And yet more, vvhen they let poore men houſes, but either increaſe the rent of them according to the benefit of their commons vvhich belong to them, or vvhich is vvorſe then that, do vtterly take away their commons from them: or vvhich is vvorſt of all, do lay townes or villages deſolate, that they themſelues may dwell alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 14. Pſalme this is made an argument of a dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in ſuch as do eate vp the people of God by their hard dealings, and yet can eate their bread without remorſe.</p>
            <p>This is to be extended alſo to all ouer-deare letting of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or any other thing that may be let.</p>
            <p>How on the other ſide may iniuſtice be committed in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of land and houſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When farmers and tenants themſelues lye ſo greedily in waite for reuerſion of leaſes, that by their bidding and outbidding one of the other, they are the workers of their owne wo.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:182:111"/>
            <p>A great part of the preſent improuements of rents hath growne vp no doubt by this meanes.</p>
            <p>But let vs haſt forward.</p>
            <p>How is iniuſtice committed in borrowing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the borrower payeth not againe, or not ſo good as he borrowed, or not at the appointed time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we reade Pſalme 37.21. Reade alſo Exod 22.14.15. and the contrary good care of reſtoring 2. Kings 6.5.</p>
            <p>How is iniuſtice committed in lending?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he that is able to lend will not do it at the need of his neighbour, vnleſſe he giue him for the lending, or leaue with him ſome vnreaſonable pawne, whether it be money or any other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary which he lendeth, though he ſuſtaine no loſſe or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade againſt theſe vniuſt and vnmercifull practiſes (for both theſe ſinnes meete in this one action) reade I ſay, Exod. 22.25.26.27. and Leuit. 25.35. &amp;c. Deut. 23.19. and chapter 24.6.10.11.12.13. and Luk. 6.34.35. Reade alſo Nehem. chap. 5. and Ezek. 22.12. But leauing this point.</p>
            <p>How is iniuſtice committed in paying of wages?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If he that ſetteth any man to vvorke, do keepe backe any part of the wages which is due according to couenant and agreement, or vvhen the payment is deferred ouer long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade concerning this point, Leuit. 19.13. Deut. 24.14.15. Iames 5.4. Mal. 3.5. which places belong alſo to ſhew the curſe due to this ſinne.</p>
            <p>How on the other ſide is iniuſtice committed in doing of worke?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If he that is hired to worke, be negligent or vnfaithfull in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty according to couenant and promiſe, or if he (preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming aboue his skill) do marre that which he taketh in hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt needs be ſo: we will not ſtand long in theſe things that be plaine. Of this kind of iniuſtice is the Counſellers negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his clients cauſe, when he hath taken his money. And the Phiſitions neglecting of his patient, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How is iniuſtice committed in the exchange of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When there is not an equall proportion kept according to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:182:112"/> vvorth and value of things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How in partnerſhip?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When either party faileth in ouerſight and labour, or putteth vp a greater part of the gaine then the couenants agreed vpon betwixt them will beare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe practiſes being vniuſt, euen in the lawfull contracting or bargaining of man with man: then (as was aunſwered) much more vniuſt is it for any, by meere vnlawfull and wicked practiſes (ſuch as are the cogging of the dice, packing of the cardes, telling of fortunes, playing of vaine and wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes, and by ſorcerous practiſes) to ſpoile their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of any part of their goods.</p>
            <p>But moſt of all (as was further anſwered) if any by crafty lawing and bribing, do vnder pretence of iuſtice defeate any man of his right, and the rather if theſe euils be furthered by by falſe ſwearing, and if they be practiſed againſt the poore, which ought not onely to be iuſtly but alſo mercifully dealt withall: that is to ſay, with the moſt gracious and fauourable iuſtice that may be.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore, and in particulars aboue that can or need be rehearſed at any one time, is iniuſtice committed by the getting of goods from other men.</p>
            <p>Now ſhew in the next place, how iniuſtice may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in detaining and withholding of other mens goods from them. How is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When any keepe them, or any part or parcell of them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they know the ſame to be none of their owne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt this point of iniuſtice, reade Exod. 23.4. Deut. 22.1.2.3. Of this ſort alſo, are ſuch as deale vnfaithfully with things committed to their cuſtody and keeping. Reade Exod. 22.7. &amp;c. and Leuit. 6.1.2.3.4. and Numb. 5. verſes 6.7.8.</p>
            <p>In this point of iniuſtice do they likewiſe greatly ſin, which faile in the performance of legacies, bequeathed by will of the deceaſed, and which interuert the goods of the poore giuen to hoſpitals, &amp;c. But moſt of all, ſuch as keepe away that which ſhould be for the maintenance of Gods pure worſhip and Religion.</p>
            <p>But let vs go forward.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:182:112"/>
            <p>In the laſt place, as touching other mens goods, iniuſtice is committed in the alienating of poſſeſſions from the right heires thereof, as was noted.</p>
            <p>To the which purpoſe conſider the Law of God, Deut. 21.15. Reade alſo Prou. 24.15.16.</p>
            <p>And thus we haue ſeene which be the kinds of iniuſtice that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the getting, detaining, &amp; alienating of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome, who do not theſe things themſelues, but onely are partakers with them that do them, and giue their conſent.</p>
            <p>What is to be ſayd of ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All ſuch by giuing their conſent to the actions of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and by their partaking in the wicked gaine thereof, they do make themſelues partakers of the ſinne, and alſo of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, by the Law both of God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The common ſaying is, If there were no receiuers, there would be no theeues. At the leaſt we may ſay, if there were no receiuers there would be the fewer theeues, and thoſe that would be ſo, ſhould be the ſooner found out, and ſuppreſſed by due correction and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Hereupon therefore, the ciuill Magiſtrate doth iuſtly puniſh the acceſſaries together with the principall, after they be found out and conuicted.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of iniuſtice concerning other mens goods.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, we are come to thoſe kinds of iniuſtice which men do commit touching their owne goods.</p>
            <p>I would haue you ſhew how that may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men may deale vniuſtly with their owne goods, either by a niggardly and faſt keeping of them, or contrariwiſe, by an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauiſh and prodigall miſpending of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, all vnthriftineſſe is a ſinne of this kind of iniuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew either of theſe extremities more particularly.</p>
            <p>And firſt, how may iniuſtice be committed in too niggardly or faſt keeping or holding of a mans owne goods?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euen ſo often as they are not wiſely &amp; liberally emploied to good and mercifull vſes, according to euery mans power and ability, and according as God himſelfe doth at any time giue iuſt and fit occaſion.</hi>

            <p>What theſe good vſes are we haue ſeene before. In which reſpect alſo, reade Prou. 11.24. The niggard therefore is not the beſt husband for himſelfe, and much leſſe for his poſterity. Reade alſo Prou. 3.9. and verſes 27.28.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo the examples of Ananias and Saphira concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their concealement, Acts 5.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, how do men commit iniuſtice by ouer-ſlauiſh and prodigall miſ-ſpending of their owne goods?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whenſoeuer any ſpend exceſſiuely, or more then is meete; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon themſelues or any other, whether it be in apparell or in building, or in belly-cheare, or in any other ſuperfluous expences: but most of all, if the expence be made vpon har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and lewd company.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that ſinne which we call Simonie, and all giuing and bequeathing of money or goods to vngodly ends and purpoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade 1. Tim. 2.10. where the holy Apoſtle oppoſeth good workes to coſtly aparell: as though he ſhould ſay, that charge ought to be limitted euen in women, to the end they might be more rich in thoſe good workes which the Apoſtle mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Now who can deny, but that men ought to be more wiſe and graue this way then women?</p>

            <p>Now touching the laſt point of iniuſtice concerning mens owne goods by vnthriftineſſe: how is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When any thing that might be well ſaued, is negligently loſt:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:182:113"/> yea, when euery thing is not wiſely and carefully employed, to the beſt and moſt profitable vſes that may be.</hi>

And note well, that both couetouſneſſe, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prodigality, &amp;c. are as the high-wayes to theft and all iniuſtice: and therefore muſt needs be here condemned.</p>

            <p>And thus we haue at the laſt attained to ſee how great and manifold iniuſtice is forbidden in this holy and righteous Commaundement of God, whereby it is cleare and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there be many kinds of theeues, beſide thoſe that in courſe of mans law come to the gallouſe: who all ſhall be arraigned before God, and condemned to hang in hell (as the common ſpeech is) whoſoeuer of them ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in time.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the negatiue part of this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The affirmatiue part followeth. But one thing firſt: What may be the reaſon why the Lord comprehendeth all iniuſtice vnder this name of theft, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not ſteale?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, becauſe deceiuable theft is the moſt vſuall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon iniuſtice practiſed among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, becauſe the name of a thiefe is commonly vſed, for the moſt odious name in this kind: and therefore alſo is moſt ſit to ſhew how odious all iniuſtice both deceiuable and violent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the occaſions, yea, the very roote thereof, is in the ſight of our moſt holy and iuſt God.</hi>

The thiefe himſelfe cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be ſo called, &amp;c. we care not ſo much if we be called hard-dealers, neare or faſt men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the affirmatiue part of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; wherein God requireth all inward graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the mind, and as fruites thereof, all outward actions and duties which be contrary to all the former vnrighteous dealings which we haue already conſidered of.</p>
            <p>Theſe good inward graces and vertues, with the outward fruites therof, as you haue heard in the Sermon concerning this point, they are many; and the ſame alſo not all of one ſort.</p>
            <p>Let vs call them to our remembrance againe.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ſuch as belong to the right manner of getting the

            </p>
            <p>Such indeed are the ſeuerall kinds of the good vertues and duties of this Commandement, in ſuch order as they haue bene declared vnto you.</p>
            <p>The particulars of either kind are next to be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>Which are the vertues of the next ſort, that is to ſay, ſuch as belong to the right maner of getting worldly riches; the which (as you truly anſwered) are preſeruatiues againſt all thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh and vniuſt dealing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is, a full and ſetled contentment of mind, with that preſent eſtate wherein God hath ſet vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is, a principall care of ſeeking after the kingdome of God, and the glorious happineſſe of the world to come: which moſt iuſtly is infinitely to be preferred before all the riches and glory of this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third is, faith in Gods holy prouidence and promiſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all meete prouiſion and maintenance for this life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth is, loue vnto righteouſneſſe, with a conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable care to deale iuſtly and faithfully in all things, both in line, weight, and meaſure; and according to all lawfull promiſes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants, agreements, and bargaines; and according to that truſt vvhich in any honeſt and good matter, either of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement, or diſtribution, or ſuperuiſorſhip, is any vvay, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by publike charge, or by priuate intreaty committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The fift is, loue to our neighbour, vvith ioy in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as if it vvere our owne.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Finally, the feare of God and of his ſecret curſe, which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon all vnrighteous dealing.</hi>

            <p>Finally, that the feare of God ſerueth as a ſpeciall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue againſt iniuſtice, reade Leuit. 25.17. and verſe 36.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore are the graces and vertues belonging to the right maner of getting or gathering of riches: whereby alſo both heart and hand is preſerued from iniuſtice.</p>
            <p>Now, as touching the ſecond ſort, belonging to the well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and beſtowing of thoſe that are well gotten, the outward fruites whereof (as hath bene anſwered) are contrary to the former vniuſt practiſes: Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vertus of this ſecond ſort are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, godly thriftineſſe, in auoiding all vaine and ſuperfluous expences, and in ſauing all that which may well be ſaued: yea, euen in the wiſe &amp; carefull employing of all things to the beſt &amp; moſt profitable vſes, in an honeſt, lawfull, and husbandly courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, a willing and chearfull yeelding of that which is any way due, either to God and his Church, or to the Prince and common-wealth, or to any priuate friend or neighbour, or to any child or ſeruant of the houſe.</hi>

            <pb n="219" facs="tcp:182:115"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, liberality towards poore neighbours dwelling neare vnto vs, and to good Chriſtians both farre and neare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, hoſpitality to the Saints and ſeruants of God, which reſort to any: ſpecially, if they be driuen from the places of their abode, by vniuſt and cruell perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the firſt point of this anſwer, reade Prou. 21.20.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond, reade Matth. 22. verſe 21. and Rom. 13.7. Iob 31.13. Prou. 27.27. and chap. 31.13. &amp;c. 21.</p>
            <p>Touching the third, Prou. 31.20. and chap. 11.24.25.26.27. Eccleſ. 11.1. &amp;c. 1. Cor. 16.1.2. and 2. Epiſt. 9.5. &amp;c. and Gal. 6.7. Epheſ. 4.28. Luke 6.35.</p>
            <p>Touching the laſt point, reade 1. Tim. 3.2. and Tit. 1.8. Heb. 13.2. and 1. Pet. 4.9.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee what that righteouſneſſe is, which God requireth of all his people, both in the well getting of riches, and alſo in the well vſing and beſtowing of them; and which be the vertues in either reſpect belonging thereunto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it may plentifully appeare, that God would haue vs ſo farre from iniuring of any, that we ſhould ſeeke the wealth and proſperity of all. We muſt be ſo farre from taking aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any becauſe of his ſimplicite, that we muſt be an eye to the blind, &amp;c. euen to helpe all ſuch, that they be not deceiued. Such therefore are the good things commanded, and ſuch alſo are the euill things forbidden in this Commandement.</p>
            <p>Now the equity of it followeth: what is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is to be conſidered diuerſe wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Declare how.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in reſpect of God himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in reſpect of thoſe that be owners and poſſeſſors of the riches and vvealth of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, in reſpect of the poore, which be in want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, in reſpect of common ſociety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore conſider of theſe things ſeuerally.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what is the equity of this Commandement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God himſelfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing God is the God of righteouſneſſe, and of all equity and iudgement; it cannot be but it muſt needs be very iuſt and equall, that he ſhould command his people all iuſtice and iudgement,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:182:116"/> and that he ſhould forbid them the contrary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Equity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And likewiſe, becauſe he (hauing the ſoueraigne right of all things in his owne hand) hath in moſt excellent vviſedome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed and diſpoſed to euery man his ſeuerall portion, as was anſwered afore concerning the ground and foundation of the righteouſneſſe of this Commandement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord in the vnequall diſtribution of the riches of this world, followeth the ſame courſe which he holdeth in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his workes. There is a differing glory of the heauenly creatures, &amp; ſo there is of the earthy in the ſeuerall kinds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He giueth to the rich abundance, that the poore may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in behold his bounteous mercy: he giueth to the poore leſſe, to ſome very litle, to other as it were nothing at all in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the reſt, that both poore and rich might behold their owne ſinne, and by ſinne their vnworthineſſe of the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this life.</p>
            <p>God maketh not all poore, becauſe he would haue ſome to relieue and ſuccour the reſt: he maketh not all rich, becauſe then none ſhould be humbled through want, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now therefore in the ſecond place, what is the equity of this Commandement, in reſpect of thoſe that be owners and poſſeſſors of the wealth of the world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe God hath not ſo paſſed away his right and intereſt vnto them, but that the fee-ſimple (as it were) remaineth ſtill in himſelfe alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The rich therefore are but as ſtewards to God, that they may giue to euery one their due portion on the Lords behalfe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they ſhall ſtand in need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: he hath not giuen to any man his riches, that he ſhould conſume them according to his owne corrupt will and luſt, but according to the will of God, who is the ſoueraigne Lord and poſſeſſor of them.</p>
            <p>It followeth in the third place, that you ſhew what the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of this Commandement is, in reſpect of thoſe that be in preſent want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe albeit God might in his iuſtice altogether withhold euery bleſſing of this life, both from poore and rich: yet, beſides that he hath commanded the rich to deale liberally vvith the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:182:116"/> poore, he himſelfe vndertaketh to be a foſter-father to prouide for them, vpon condition that they will patiently beare their wants, diligently follow their callings, and in all things deale truly and iuſtly vvith all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe it is, that God calleth himſelfe in ſpeciall maner, the father of the fatherleſſe, and of euery one that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute: though he be indeed the generall foſter-father of all mankind.</p>
            <p>Such therefore is the equity of this Commandement in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God himſelfe; and alſo in reſpect of the rich, and of the poore conſidered a part by themſelues.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt place, what is the equity of it, in reſpect of common ſociety?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord God, as pleaſeth him, doth oftentimes for iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes knowne to himſelfe, make the rich poore, and the poore rich: and therefore great equity that they vvhich be rich now, ſhould relieue and ſuccour thoſe that be preſently poore, that the poore againe, whoſoeuer from among them ſhall be made rich, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe relieue and ſuccour ſuch as ſhall be impoueriſhed by the hand of God, vvhether they themſelues or any of their poſterity; as it often falleth out, vvithin a fevv generations, yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in one and the ſame age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that equity which the Apoſtle Paul reaſoneth from, that he might moue the faithfull Corinthians who were for the preſent more wealthy, to helpe the afflicted Chriſtians at Ieruſalem, 2. Cor. chap. 8. verſes 13.14.15. Reade alſo Prou. 27.24. and Pſalme 113.</p>
            <p>Thus then, the equity of this Commandement (the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is true iuſtice and iudgement concerning our neighbours goods and our owne) it is as you haue anſwered very manifold.</p>
            <p>This Law of God therefore being ſo equall, it followeth hereupon (according to that which we haue ſeene concerning the former Commandement) that all the curſes threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tranſgreſſions of it, are likewiſe very equall and iuſt.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore now come to conſider of them.</p>
            <p>And that in the ſame order, wherein the ſinnes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den haue bene ſet downe and rehearſed: not of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:182:117"/> (for that would be ouerlong for vs at this time) but of the more generall heads, and of the particulars which be more principall and chiefe among the reſt, ſo neare as we can.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, what is the curſe againſt the tyrant, which openly violateth all iuſtice, to worke his owne ambitious and licentious will, which he maketh his ſoueraigne Law, for the ſpoiling of other men of their goods, to the enriching of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and wast not ſpoiled, and doſt vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, and they did not wickedly againſt thee (ſaith the Lord by his holy Prophet Iſaiah) when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoile, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled, and vvhen thou ſhalt make an end to do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhall do wickedly againſt thee, chap.</hi> 33.1.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Hab. chap. 2.5.6. &amp;c. 12. and Prou. 21.7. The rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery of the wicked ſhall deſtroy them, for they haue refuſed to execute iudgement.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe or puniſhment againſt the thiefe, which maketh ſtealing as it were his profeſſed practiſe and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to liue by?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ciuill courſe of Gods iuſtice in Iſrael, it was for the ſtolen oxe, reſtitution of fiue oxen, and for the ſtolen ſheepe foure fold reſtitution, if the thiefe ſhould haue killed or ſold them: becauſe that is as it were the perfect conuiction of the theft. But if the cattell ſhould be found aliue vvith the thiefe, then the Lord commaunded but double reſtitution. Yet ſo, as if the party could not make reſtitution, either double or more, as the cauſe ſhould require: that then he ſhould looſe his freedome, and be ſold for a bond-ſlaue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the Law of God, as we reade Exod. chapter 22. verſes 1.4.</p>
            <p>The ſame penalty of double reſtitution is layed vpon the thiefe, that ſtealeth any thing out of a mans houſe: as we reade in the ſame Chapter, verſe 7. Yet ſo againe, as if the ſtealth be attempted in way of burglary, and breaking vp of the houſe, and that alſo in the night time, he is put out of the protection of the Law, as an outlawed man, ſo as if he be ſlaine in his enterpriſe, he that killed him is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:182:117"/> quit from murther,<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note> the bloud of the thiefe is vpon his owne head, verſes. 2.3. That manifold reſtitution therefore, or for want of reſtitution, the loſſe of libertie, and this vile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the thiefe his life in the caſe of burglarie; ſhew that they are vnder the curſe of God, touching this life and the things that belong to the comfort thereof.</p>
            <p>Of this kind of more open and profeſſed theft, there was a moſt grieuous practiſe of man-ſtealing among the Iſraelites, &amp; ſelling them to the heathen. What is the puniſhment which God in his ciuill iuſtice appointeth vnto it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thiefe ſhall dye (ſaith the Lord) ſo ſhalt thou put e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill away from among you, Deut. chap.</hi> 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>This is a very great ſinne, to betray any mans libertie, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the libertie and freedome which any of Gods people haue with their brethren in the worſhip of God, &amp;c. as Dauid complaineth in the 1. of Sam. 26.19. And therefore the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this theft is increaſed by a more grieuous tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The greatneſſe of this ſinne may euidently appeare, by the contrarie patronage, which the Lord graunteth vnto him that ſhall flie from the heathen to his people, for the loue of their religion: as we reade Deut. 23.15.16.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt not (ſaith the Lord to Iſrael) deliuer the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to his maiſter, which is eſcaped from his maiſter vnto thee.</p>
            <p>He ſhall dwell with thee, euen among you, in what place he ſhall choſe, in any of thy cities where it liketh him beſt: thou ſhalt not vexe him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of this kind of ſinne (as hath bene ſhewed before) is the ſtealing away of any mans daughter or ſonne out from his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement; though it be not to ſell them to ſtraungers, but to marrie them at their diſpoſition, they hauing no right to deale in that action. And ſeeing it is of this kind of ſinne, it cannot be doubted, but the like curſe and puniſhment from the wrath of God, belongeth vnto it.</p>
            <p>And though any be ſpared in this life, yet without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no thiefe ſhall eſcape the ſpirituall ſentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: as 1. Cor. 6.10. No thieues ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord promiſeth great plentie and abundance of all his bleſſings, to ſuch ſpecially, if there be a generall and publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; care herein: as it is plentifully declared, Prou. ch.</hi> 3.9.10.

            <p>Theſe places of holy Scripture do plentifully declare it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Let vs diligently reade and conſider of them.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Zephan. 3.13. for the ground of this bleſsing, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people in whom the Lord delighteth, is ſuch a people, as do no iniquitie nor ſpeake lyes, and where a deceitfull tong is not found in their mouth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the promiſe of bleſsing. It is time that we come to the vſe.</p>
            <p>Haue you perfectly obeyed this eight Commaundement, that you may looke thereby to eſcape the curſe, and to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the bleſsing thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No: I haue not perfectly obeyed it. But in many things both leſſer and greater, I haue dealt deceitfully: and continually, both I and all other do faile in the beſt actions of righteouſneſſe that we do performe, according as it is written: There is none righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no not one, Rom. chap.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>This ſentence is generall, concerning all actions that haue equitie and right in them; whether they belong to riches, or a mans perſon, or anie other thing, in the moſt generall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and therefore it muſt needs condemne vs all of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe againſt this Commaundement, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And further alſo, as we haue done in all the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements: let vs for our comfort enquire now henceforth, from what ground of holy Scripture we may ſtrengthen our faith, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath perfectly obeyed this Law for vs, according as we haue ſeene how he hath obeyed all that we haue interpreted before. For ſo it is neceſſatie for vs, that we do know, that we haue ſuch a Sauiour, as is perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the obedience of euerie Commandement: and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching that more particular righteouſneſſe, which is here commaunded. And if we do not know and beleeue our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt to be ſuch a one, we cannot poſsiblie be ſaued by him.</p>
            <p>Shew you therefore, what proofe you haue thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the testimonies of our Sauiour Chriſt his righteouſneſſe in generall, they muſt needes proue his righteouſneſſe in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this Commaundement. But beſides them, we haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:182:121"/> proofes more properly belonging to our preſent purpoſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts perfect obedience for vs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs conſider either of theſe kinds of proofes, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>And firſt which are the generall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 23. <hi>of Ieremie verſe</hi> 5. <hi>the holy Prophet hath prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him, that he ſhould be a righteous braunch, and that he ſhould execute iudgement and righteouſneſſe in the earth. And in the next verſe: that both Iudah &amp; Iſrael, ſhall call him the Lord our righteouſnes. There are many other ſuch like teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: ſo we reade againe in the ſame prophecie, chap. 33.15.16. In thoſe dayes, and at that time will I cauſe the braunch of righteouſneſſe to grow vp vnto Dauid, and he ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgement and righteouſneſſe in the land: In thoſe dayes ſhall Iudah be ſaued. And thus we haue the generall confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe, the which do include the righteouſneſſe commanded in this eight Commandement. Neuertheles, the particular proofes are not to be ouerpaſſed:</p>
            <p>Rehearſe ſome of them alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like as the Prophet Iſaiah prophecied of our Sauiour Chriſt before he came into the world, clothed as it were vvith our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that he ſhould do no violence, and that no deceit ſhould be in his mouth, as we reade chap.</hi> 53. <hi>verſe the</hi> 9. <hi>So the Apostle Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhortly after he had manifeſted himſelfe to the world, beareth faithfull witneſſe to the ſame,</hi> 1. <hi>Epist. chap.</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p>This alſo is that which was typically prophecied of our Sauiour Chriſt vnder the kingdome of king Salomon, Pſalm. 72.14. where it is ſaid, that he ſhould redeeme the ſoules of his people from deceit and violence, by the execution of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the enemies of the Church, and by exerciſing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie toward the reſt. Reade the Pſalme.</p>
            <p>And here againe, let vs call to mind, that the chief heads or parts of iniuſtice, are theſe two, deceit and violence: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Apoſtle Paule, 1. Theſ. 4. where he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to forbid all iniuſtice, he ſaith: Let no man oppreſſe nor defraud his brother.</p>
            <p>So then, ſeeing our Sauiour Chriſt is free from either of theſe points of iniuſtice; yea, ſeing he redeemeth his people from them, according to that 72. Pſalme it followeth, that he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:182:122"/> is, by the vndoubted teſtimonies of the holy Scriptures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous. But it may peraduenture be thought of ſome but a ſmall matter, though our Sauiour Chriſt did no violence, ſeeing he was to the world-ward in poore and weake eſtate: and therefore that the particular proofe of his righteouſneſſe muſt ſtand rather in the confirmation of this, that he vſed no deceit, nor anie craftie and vnlawfull ſhifts to helpe himſelfe, though he was poore &amp;c. What haue you to ſay to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is to be confeſſed, that a principall part of our particular proofe doth moſt apparantly conſiſt in this point. Neuertheleſſe, albeit our Sauiour Chriſt had no worldly power and authoritie, after the manner of men; yet he could by his diuine power haue conſumed his enemies, or caſt them from their dignitie, or waſted their ſubſtance, &amp;c. But he choſe rather meekely to endure all iniuries and wrongs, which all men did against him, euen to the rifling of him, and to the caſting of lots vpon the inmoſt garment that was vpon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore ſheweth plainely, that the righteouſneſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt was excellent eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſight of the world, in that he did forbeare all ſuch dealing, as might at the leaſt haue had the ſhew of a violent courſe, though he could haue reuenged himſelfe vpon his enemies, as you haue anſwered. For he that threw the Diuels out of that poſſeſsion which they had taken of the perſons of men, he could much more eaſily in all reaſon, haue throwne men out of their poſſeſsion of houſes and goods, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He that by the ſound of his voice (when he might ſeeme to be at the weakeſt) made the ſouldiers which came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him in the garden to fall downe backeward, Iohn 18.6. he could haue taken all ſtrength and courage from anie other, and haue deliuered himſelfe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But he would in no wiſe worke any reuenge, but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all to him that iudgeth righteouſly, 1. Pet. 2.23.</p>
            <p>For as touching that which he did, concerning the heardes of the ſwine of the Gaderenites, Matth. 8.30. he did it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt holy reſpects, and not for anie the leaſt carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. Nay, we ſee how he plainely reiecteth that kind of motion which his owne diſciples made vnto him, againſt the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:182:122"/> Samaritanes that would not lodge him. Luke chapter 9. verſes 54.55.56.</p>
            <p>Perfect therfore was the righteouſneſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt in auoiding all violence, yea in the meeke enduring of all wrongs.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the proofe of his righteouſneſſe, from the particular conſideration of his poore and baſe eſtate as touching the world.</p>
            <p>How can you declare him to haue bene righteous therein?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe from the time that our Sauiour Chriſt came to a meete and conuenient age, and thenceforth ſo long as he liued with his parents, he wrought diligently in the worke and labour of Ioſephs occupation, Marke chap.</hi> 6.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And afterward, vvhen the time vvas come, that he ſhould more immediatly do the vvill of his heauenly Father, he (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no houſe of his ovvne to hide his head in, as vve reade Mat. chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>and painefully going about from place to place to preach the Goſpell) moſt vvillingly contented himſelfe vvith that maintenance onely, vvhich grevv vnto him as a fruite from his preaching, no othervviſe then as God moued the hearts of thoſe that receiued ſpirituall comfort from him, to minister of their outvvard things vnto him, Luke chap.</hi> 8.2.3.</p>
            <p>This he did, all the time wherein he went about preaching, euen till (as a reward from the hands of wicked men) he was put to death, and nayled to the croſſe betweene two thieues which were crucified with him; they counting him among tranſgreſſors, as the Prophet Iſaiah ſaith, as if he had bene a moſt vnrighteous perſon: though in truth (as the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teſtifieth) he neuer did anie violence, neither practiſed any deceit, as hath bene noted before out of the 53. chapter of his Propheſie.</p>
            <p>And further alſo, that our Sauiour Chriſt was free from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, we haue a principall and moſt euident proofe, euen from the beginning of his entrance into the diſcharge of his publike miniſterie: at what time the Diuell tempted him moſt ſubtilly diuerſe wayes, and namely to ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of earthly glorie, pompe, dignitie, and riches, but he could not preuaile.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:182:123"/>
            <p>Behold therefore a ſingular proofe of our Sauiour Chriſt his perfect righteouſneſſe, in his contentment with his poore eſtate, patiently enduring hunger and thirſt, neuer vſing any vnlawfull meanes to relieue himſelfe, but reſted vpon Gods prouidence by faith, as is euident by his anſwere to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: Man liueth not by bread only, but by euerie word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By this righteouſneſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt, are we iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all our vnrighteouſneſſe againſt this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we do truely beleeue in him, and earneſtly repent, and labour after righteous dealing, remembring that this is one principall end of our redemption and iuſtification, Luke 1.75. and Titus 2.9.10.11. and 1. Pet. 2.24.</p>
            <p>And that all ſuch as do thus repent of their vnrighteouſneſſe and beleeue in the name of Chriſt, be iuſtified by him, and are receiued into the fauour of God, reade Acts 10.35. Reade alſo Leuiticus 6.1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Conſider here of the thiefe repenting on the croſſe.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo the example of Zacheus, Luke 19.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Leuiticus, chapter 24.18.21. with Numbers 5. verſes 6.7. and Exodus 21.33.34.35.36. and chapter 22.1.2.3.4.5.6. &amp;c. Where alſo note, that as a fruite of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, reſtitution is commaunded by God, and practiſed of his ſeruaunts; yea and that with ſome recompence, in way of ſatisfaction in a ciuill courſe of iuſtice.</p>
            <p>But what if a man knoweth not whome, nor how many he hath iniured, and is ſorie for it, and would gladly make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but he knoweth not how?</p>
            <p>What is to be done in this caſe, which is ſurely more or leſſe, the condition and caſe of vs all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We muſt ſo much the more ſpeedily breake off our former courſe, and accordingly be ſo much the more carefull to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe both iustice and mercie, then heretofore at any time vve haue bene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is indeed the bleſſed counſell of the Prophet Daniel to Nebucadnezzer that great robber and ſpoiler of the nations of the world, chapter 4.24. O King (ſaith the Prophet) let my counſell be acceptable to thee, and breake off thy ſinnes
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:182:123"/> by righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Anabaptiſts communitie of goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> and thine iniquitie by mercie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion toward the poore; lo, let there be an healing of thine error.</p>
            <p>The like, is the generall counſell and charge of the Apoſtle Paul, to euerie vniuſt perſon, yea euen to the pettie thiefe, Eph. 4.28. Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, but let him labour and worke with his hands the thing which is good, that he may haue to giue vnto him that needeth.</p>
            <p>And now onely for the concluſion of this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let vs after all the premiſes, obſerue (as a truth moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and cleare againſt all Anabaptiſtes) that the Lord doth at no hand approue of their confuſed communitie of goods. Nay this Commaundement leuelleth, as it were the maine ſhot of the Lords ordinance, to the vtter batterie and ouerthrow of it, euen to the worlds end, according to the perpetuitie of the force and power of this his expreſſe morall Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <p>As touching the communion of goods which was among the Chriſtians in the primitiue Church in the Apoſtles time, it was no ſuch as they imagine, but onely the kindneſſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie practiſed among them was verie extraordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding to the releeuing of the common and great neceſsitie of the poore Chriſtians. The ſame God who wrought that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant loue and liberalitie in them, and yet preſerued them from all barbarous and fantaſticall confuſion, he for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake, graunt that all true profeſſors of his bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpell, may more and more honour it, with daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of all liberall and kind dealing, with like preſeruation of the ground of iuſtice, in that proprietie of goods and poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he by his good prouidence hath ſet and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among his people, Amen.</p>
            <p>The ninth Commaundement of the Law of God now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: Which is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe against thy neighbour.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After the former Commaundement therefore of righteous dealing, followeth now the Law of true ſpeaking: according as they are in the ſame order rehearſed in diuerſe other places of holy Scripture, and namely, Leuiticus. 19.11. Pſalme 15.2. and Pſalm. 119. verſe 138. Epheſ. 4.24.25. and chap. 5.9.</p>
            <p>For the vnderſtanding of the which Commaundement ye may remember that ye were taught, that three things are to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, vvho is to be reputed and taken for a mans neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, vvho he is that muſt not beare falſe vvitneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, vvhat it is to beare falſe vvitneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the firſt of theſe points: whom haue you learned that we ought to repute and take for our neighbour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue learned that this vvord neighbour, comprehendeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one vvithout reſpect of perſons, concerning vvhom vve haue iuſt occaſion to yeeld our teſtimonie in any matter, vvhich on his behalfe is called into queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is: and thus generally is the ſame word neighbour to be vnderſtood in the ſixt, ſeuenth, and eight Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments going before, although it is not expreſſed till now: Thou ſhalt not murther any neighbour, &amp;c. that is, no man. For this generall ſignification of the word neighbour, reade Luk. chap. 10. verſe 29. &amp;c. to the 38.</p>
            <p>Now touching the ſecond point, who is he whom God forbiddeth to beare falſe witneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All ſtand ſtreightly charged here vvithall, but ſpecially they vvhoſe falſe teſtimonie may do most hurt: and namely ſuch as be in credite vvith great perſons, and ſuch as are called foorth to giue vvitneſſe in any vveightie matter vpon their oth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, conſider the admonition of Iohn Baptiſt to thoſe ſouldiers that would know of him what they ſhould do. The holy ſeruant of God being as wiſe as zealous, knowing that they might do ſpeciall hurt, by their falſe accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any to their Captaine, he giueth them ſpeciall warning againſt this ſinne, Luk. chap. 3.14. The like is to be ſaid of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any like place, wherein they may procure any ſpeciall
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:182:124"/> miſchiefe by the ſame meanes. The third point followeth.<note place="margin">Sinnes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Shew therefore what it is for any to beare falſe witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his neighbour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To beare falſe witneſſe, is to vtter and affirme any vntruth, how litle ſoeuer the ſame may either diſcredite or impayre the good name of any man: or procure any other the leaſt hurt or daunger againſt him, either in life, honeſtie, or goods, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if it be againſt the ſpirituall happineſſe and ſaluation of his ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: falſe witneſſe reacheth as farre as doth all that, for the which anie man may be worthie to be either iuſtified or condemned in the ſight of God or men: as may be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exemplified through euerie Commaundement, both of the firſt and alſo of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſecond Table.</p>
            <p>And further, though this ſinne of falſe witneſſe bearing, is grieuous in the leaſt degree; yet it is to be eſteemed more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, according to the greatneſſe of the accuſation which is falſely laid to the charge of any man: ſpecially of ſuch a man as hath beſt deſerued to be well ſpoken of, &amp;c. Falſe accuſation in capitall matters is more hainous then in matters otherwiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: in matters belonging to God, more then in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to men, a certaine proportion of one degree of ſinne compared with another: before the magiſtrate and by oth, more then priuately and by bare affirmation: deliberately more then raſhly: by writing or open printing, more then by word of mouth: by a Magiſtrate or Miniſter of the word, more then by a priuate perſon: againſt a ſocietie, more then againſt one perſon: againſt whole Churches and nations, more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome few among them. Finally, God forbidding falſe witneſſe in the matters of the naturall life and bodie, muſt needs be vnderſtood, much rather to forbid falſe witneſſe to the euerlaſting perill of mens ſoules, which are more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then their bodies and whole outward and worldly eſtate.</p>
            <p>But not only the firſt inuenter of the falſe accuſation is here condemned, of whom it is ſaid, He that inuenteth ſlaunder is a foole, that is to ſay, a wicked man. Prouerbes chapter 10.18. but alſo, he that is ouer-light of giuing credite to it,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:182:125"/> or to anie vncertaine rumors, of whom alſo it is ſaid: The foole beleeueth euerie thing, Prou. 14.15. Reade alſo Exod. 23.1. Yea it is a ſinne in anie not to ſtay and ſuppreſſe ſuch flying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as we are after more fully to conſider. And for this cauſe it is, that God giueth the magiſtrate eſpecially, ſo ſpeciall a charge as he doth, to examine the falſe witneſſe verie diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and that no man ſhould be condemned vnder two or three witneſſes, Exod. chap. 23.6.7.8. and Deut. 17.14.6.7. and chapter 19.16. &amp;c. Reade alſo Iohn 7.51.</p>
            <p>But that we may proceed:</p>
            <p>Is falſe witneſſe borne onely by affirming a falſhood, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vntruth againſt a mans neighbour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No: for falſe witneſſe may be borne by the deniall and gaine-ſaying of that which is true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is like reaſon of either of theſe. This was the ſinne of Zidkijah the ſon of Chenaanah againſt Micaiah, 1. King. 22.24.</p>
            <p>It is an euill, that is generally verie readie with all of vs, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning our owne excuſe, if there be not the greater grace. See in the example of Sarah, Gen. 18.15. yea though ſhe was a good woman.</p>
            <p>That which we will do for the excuſing and benefiting of our ſelues, as we take it, we will not ſticke (if naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preuaile) to do the like to the hurt of him whom we take to be our enemie: we will denie or leſſen all the good which he hath done, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This kind of bad dealing, there is no doubt, but the Lord condemneth it for falſe witneſſe bearing.</p>
            <p>But ſome man peraduenture will aske, what if my falſe witneſſe may helpe my good neighbour, and be no hinderance to anie other, either friend or fo: may I not in ſuch a caſe make that lye; which they beautifie with the name of an officious or dutifull lye? VVhat is to be ſaid to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No euill muſt either be done or ſpoken that any good or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite may come of it. Neither in truth can any good fruite come of it, but rather it will proue ouer officious and hurtfull, ſpecially to the euill doer or ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ker himſelfe, if God do not pardon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God the author of all that is good and true, yea who is all on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodneſſe and truth, he will doubtles work, &amp; further them
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:182:125"/> by true dealing and true ſpeaking: and therefore doth ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require, that we ſerue his bleſſed prouidence onely in the way of truth, reade Rom. 3. verſes 4.5.6.7.8.</p>
            <p>It is true that in ſome caſes God hath borne with the weakeneſſe of his ſeruants this way, when in their hearts they haue minded to ſerue his good prouidence, but haue failed in their right choiſe of the right way and meanes: as Rebecka and Iaakob did for the obtaining of the bleſſing, Gen. 27. and the mid-wiues of Egypt for the preſeruation of the liues of the male-children of the Iſraelies, Exod. chap. 1. and Dauid for the preſeruation of his owne life, 1. Sam. 21.1.2.3. and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes 12.13. But ſuch examples (being as it were out-rules) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be followed without great daunger, to thoſe that will of purpoſe draw them to an inordinate courſe of imitation.</p>
            <p>Is there no way elſe, whereby a man may beare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt his neighbour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes: he may do it alſo by miſconſtruing and deprauing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the meaning of his vvords, or the purpoſe and intent of his actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the former maner of deprauing the words and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpeaker, were the aduerſaries of our Sauiour Chriſt falſe witneſſes againſt him: reade Iohn chap. 2.19. compared with Matth. 26.60.61. and chap. 27.39.40. wherein that was fulfilled which we reade Pſal. 35.11.12. And thus alſo dealt the falſe witneſſes and accuſers of Stephen, and of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of our Sauiour Chriſt, Acts 6.11. and chapter. 7.58. and chap. 16.20.21. After the latter maner was Ahimelech accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Doeg, 1. Sam. 21.7. and chap. 22.9. &amp;c. And Nehemiah by Sanballat and Geſhem, Nehem. chap. 6.5.6. &amp;c. and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt alſo, Iohn. 19.12. All theſe falſe witneſſes in either reſpect following therein the ſuggeſtion of the Diuell the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes, Iohn chap. 8. and the accuſers of the brethren, Reue. 12.10. Which wickedneſſe the Lord expreſly forbiddeth, Leu. 19.16. Thou ſhalt not walke about with tales: where note the ſignification of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>racil</hi> comming of the verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>racal</hi> which is by making marchandiſe to ſeeke gaine: See <hi>Tremel.</hi> By this therefore which hath bene ſayd, we may ſufficiently perceiue that all kind of lying, ſlandering, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:182:126"/> back-biting is forbidden in this Commandement: whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our foe, or for our friend, or for our owne aduantage, reade Leuit. 19.11.</p>
            <p>We may not lye of the Diuell, according as it is truly ſayd: It is a ſhame to lye of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>As we muſt not vſe curſed ſpeech, Iude verſe 9. ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we vſe lying ſpeech againſt him, and therefore much leſſe againſt our neighbour, yea, our good neighbour. We may not lye on Gods behalfe, Iob 13.4.7.8.9.10. Rom. 3.7.8. much leſſe for mans cauſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, we muſt not lie againſt our ſelues, by flattering and bleſſing our ſelues while we walke in wicked wayes. For this is to truſt in lying words, as the Lord ſaith by his Prophet Ieremiah, chapter 7.4. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Truſt not in lying words, &amp;c. Not that thoſe words were ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelues, but becauſe hypocrites vnder that pretence ſoothed themſelues in an outward profeſſion of Gods reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without amendment of their liues.</p>
            <p>But haue we now all the euils and ſinnes which the Lord forbiddeth in this holy Commandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, we haue not: It is alſo againſt the will of God in this Commandement, that any ſhould conceale that truth vvhich ought to be vttered: either for the benefit of our good neighbor, or for the rebuke and chaſtiſement of him that is euill: as alſo that on the other ſide, any ſhould vnſeaſonably vtter and diſcloſe that truth, vvhich for the preſent ought to be kept ſecret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreouer, it is againſt this Commandement that any ſhould praiſe that which ought to be diſcommended, or commend that vvhich ought to be diſpraiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, to praiſe and encourage, or to diſpraiſe and diſcomfort raſhly, and without good and diſcret moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, all vaine-glorious boaſting and hunting after our owne praiſe, together vvith all diſſembling and double dealing; yea, all want of plainneſſe and ſimplicity, which vvill not ſtand with good duty, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the obedience of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe no doubt are tranſgreſſions of this Commandement: for they hinder the truth, that it cannot be acknowledged and aduanced as it ought to be: and likewiſe they hinder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:182:126"/> of vice and wickedneſſe of life, that it cannot be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and condemned, as it ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Now this we know, that he who iuſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, they are euen both of them abomination to the Lord, Pro. 17.15. And againe, chap. 28.4. They that forſake the Law praiſe the wicked; but they that keepe the Law, ſet themſelues againſt them.</p>
            <p>To praiſe aboue meaſure, is flattery: of the which it is ſaid, that he which flattereth his neighbour, ſpreadeth a net for his ſteppes, Prou. 29.5.</p>
            <p>Detracting is a ſinne on the other hand, againſt the which reade Pſalme 15.</p>
            <p>Againſt vaine boaſting, reade Prou. 27.1. and againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and double dealing, reade againe Pſal. 12.2. They ſpeake deceiptfully, and Pſal. 41.6.</p>
            <p>And thus we haue ſeene what be the externall ſinnes and tranſgreſſions forbidden in this Commandement.</p>
            <p>But not onely are theſe outward euils forbidden, but alſo all thoſe inward vices and hidden corruptions of the heart, which be as the roote and cauſe of theſe.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore now, which thoſe inward euils &amp; vices be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of this ſort, are all vncharitable and groundleſſe ſuſpitions, all raſh iudging and taking of ſuch things in the vvorſt part which may be vvell conſtrued, and chiefly all hatred and malignant enuy againſt our neighbours good name, credit, and vvelfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are indeed the inward euils of the heart, from the which all falſe witneſſe, lying, and ſlandering do ſpring, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we reade Matth. 15.19. Out of the heart (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) come euill thoughts, &amp;c. falſe teſtimonies and ſlaunders. Reade alſo the ground of the ſame euils noted Prou. 21.10.</p>
            <p>Againſt euill ſuſpitions. Reade 1. Tim. 6.4. a fruit of corrupt doctrine.</p>
            <p>Againſt raſh iudging, reade Matth. 7.1.2.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo the ſinne of Iobs friends. Reade alſo Luke 13.1. and Iohn. 9.2.</p>
            <p>Againſt the taking of things in euill part, and whiſperings, reade Rom. 1.29.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:182:127"/>
            <p>And of enuy it is ſayd: who can ſtand before it, Prou. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 27.4.</p>
            <p>But yet one thing more, that we may conclude the negatiue part of this ninth Commandement.</p>
            <p>Is this Law of God fulfilled, if we for our owne parts auoid the euils, both inward and outward, which haue bene men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, though we ſhould allow or winke at the ſame ſinnes in others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, in no caſe: but contrariwiſe, God requireth that vve hate them in other, as vvell as in our ſelues: and that, as much as lyeth in vs, vve reproue, repreſſe, and ſharply correct and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for ſeeing God abhorreth all falſe witneſſe, lying, and ſlaundering, &amp;c. Prou. 6.19. and chap. 12.22. it cannot in any reaſon be thought, but that he requireth alſo that all his ſeruants ſhould likewiſe do ſo. And ſo it is expreſly teſtified, Prou. 13.5. A righteous man hateth the lying word (or falſe matter) whatſoeuer it be. On the contrary, he is affirmed to be a wicked man, whoſoeuer he be that giueth heed to falſe lippes, Prou. 17.4. and againe, chap. 29.12. Wherefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily it is to be noted to be the property of a godly man, to ſhew an angry countenance againſt the ſlaundering tongue, chap. 25.23. And Pſalme 101.5. King Dauid ſpeaking in the holy zeale of Gods Spirit, ſaith: Him that priuily ſlandereth his neighbour, will I deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Pſalme 140.10. and Pſal. 31.18. a fearefull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation againſt this ſinne: Gal. 2.11. &amp;c. See the zeale of the Apoſtle Paule againſt Peter diſſembling. And Luke 23.50.51. the praiſe of Ioſeph of Arimathea, for not conſenting with the reſt to giue ſentence againſt our Sauiour Chriſt vpon the falſe accuſation brought againſt him. And Iohn 9.50.51. the like practiſe of Nicodemus is recorded.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we according to that meaſure of grace which God hath vouchſafed for the preſent, the whole negatiue part of this Commandement, and from thence alſo, a fit paſſage to the affirmatiue part, which now followeth.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore hencefoorth, by the renewing as it were of our treatiſe, for our further and more full inſtruction, what
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:182:127"/> on the contrary,<note place="margin">Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> are the good duties which our righteous God, the God of truth commandeth vs in this his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord God ſtraightly commandeth euery man, in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to ſpeake and vvitneſſe the truth, and to teſtifie againſt all falſhood, lies, and ſlanders, to the due credite, commendation, and ſafety of euery neighbour, wherein he doth well: or for his due reproofe and correction vvherein he hoth euill, and for the ending of contentions and controuerſies betwixt man and man: vvhether vve be lawfully called forth, to do it vpon our oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Magiſtrate, or that we haue any iuſt occaſion more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately ſo to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be otherwiſe concerned, but that the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding falſe witneſſe-bearing againſt our neighbour to his diſcredit or hurt, doth on the contrary command the ſpeaking and witneſſing of the truth for his benefit or credit.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it often falleth out, that a mans good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour cannot be benefited and relieued, but the wicked and falſe accuſation or lye of another muſt therewithall be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: therefore it muſt needs be, that a true witneſſe muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt euery euill neighbour, to his iuſt rebuke and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>And generally, it is to be conſidered, that all diſcouery and reproofe of lies and ſlaunders, to the diſcredit of the wicked: it is on the behalfe of euery good neighbour, and of the truth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is for the benefit of our neighbour, who hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any ſinne which is to be diſcouered, that we do therein witneſſe againſt him, that by the iuſt rebuke and correction of his ſinne, he may be brought to true repentance.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, becauſe euen good neighbours, may be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance for want of the knowledge of the truth; therefore it is further added, that this is the vſe of bearing a true witneſſe, to end controuerſie and contention, according to that we reade Heb. 6.16.</p>
            <p>But not onely in iudiciall courſe of iudgements before the Magiſtrate or Iudge of the court: but alſo in all priuate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and teſtimonies, God requireth that we alwayes ſpeake
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:182:128"/> and affirme the truth, to the benefit of our neighbour, in the way of righteouſneſſe and truth, &amp;c. reade Epheſ. 4.25. and Coloſ. 3.8.</p>
            <p>Thus then (to ſpeake in a word) the briefe ſumme of this Commandement is truth of ſpeech commanded for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our neighbour: yea, euen for the mutuall benefit of one neighbour by another, according as it is written: A faithfull witneſſe deliuereth ſoules, but a deceiuer ſpeaketh lies, Prou. chapter 14.25.</p>
            <p>But hereunto, as vnto a very great and waighty duty, there are diuerſe excellent vertues and graces neceſſarily required, as you haue bene taught.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is, an harty loue and zealous affection to the truth in generall, with a vvilling and ready chearfulneſſe of mind, to giue witneſſe vnto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond is, a particular knowledge and aſſurance of the truth of euery matter vvhereunto vve do giue vvitneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third is incorrupt affection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oid of all ill will and hatred, or of partiality and flattery, touching the perſon whom our teſtimony concerneth: whether he be friend or foe, howſoeuer we ſhall esteeme of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth is, ſimplicity and plainneſſe in the declaration of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt is, conſtancy in ſtanding to the confirmation of that truth which is once vprightly and faithfully affirmed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe vertues, which I call an harty loue and zealous affection to the truth in generall: I do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extend it in this place, to the witneſſing of that truth which pertaineth to the outward ſafety and credit of euery neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but alſo to the witneſſing of the whole truth, which is according to godlineſſe, Tit. cha. 1.1. And as it is ſaid of the true ſeruant of God, that he ſpeaketh the truth in his heart, Pſa. 15.2.</p>

            <p>Concerning the third vertue, note that the truth is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any perſon, and before euery reward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all diſpleaſure, whatſoeuer may ariſe from the teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.

            <p>Concerning the laſt, reade Tit. 1.9. for that which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt do for his part, in the great truth of God: the like is to be performed of all in euery truth. It is a foule ſinne in euery ſuch one, as ſhall be ready to ſhrinke backe from any true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when they perceiue their land-lord, or ſome other great man to be offended therewithall.</p>
            <p>All theſe vertues, and if there be any other like to theſe, they are carefully to be regarded in bearing witneſſe, as euery man will anſwer before God: with whom truth in euery mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very precious.</p>
            <p>But that we may go forward.</p>

               <hi>Yes, God doth moreouer command vs in this his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to performe euery other good dutie, vvhereby both the good name, and alſo the good and comfortable eſtate of our neighbour, may not onely be continued ſo much as vve may procure, but likewiſe vvhereby the ſame may be recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if by any occaſion they be loſt and impaired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this muſt needes be required, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall law of loue to our neighbour, whoſe good name and comfortable eſtate, ſhould be as deare vnto vs as our owne ought to be.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore in the firſt place, which thoſe duties be, that are to be performed for the continuance and preſeruation of our neighbours good name, and of his good eſtate?</p>
            <pb n="246" facs="tcp:182:129"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, it is euery mans dutie to teach and inſtruct his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in euery good vvay of God wherein he ſhall perceiue him to be ignorant and to want counſell: yea, it is euery mans duty, to exhort and ſtirre vp his neighbour to all care and conſcience, to vvalke in obedience to euery Commandement of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, it is euery mans duty to yeeld euery neighbour his due praiſe, for all his godly vviſedome and care, and for euery good grace and vertue in the vvell ordering of his life, and to incourage him to continue and increaſe therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, God requireth, that in all actions or ſpeeches (though ſomething doubtfull and ſuſpicious) we hope and ſpeake the beſt of euery good neighbour, vntill the contrary ſhall breake forth and be knowne; yet ſo, as in the meane while, vve admoniſh them to vſe better aduiſement, and ſpeedily to remoue all cauſes of ſuſpition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that each neighbour be faithfull and truſty, in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſecrets of the other vvhatſoeur may lawfully, and of faithfull loue to our neighbour ought to be concealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe points, reade 1. Theſ. 5.11. Heb. 3.13.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo, Mal. 3.16. and Iſaiah 2.3. As touching that which we reade Ier. 31.34. And they ſhall teach no more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man his neighbour, and euery man his brother, ſaying: Know the Lord, &amp;c. this doth not prohibit this duty, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in way of compariſon, ſetteth out the abundance of knowledge in the time of the Goſpell, aboue the time of the Law, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That there is continuall need of mutuall inſtruction: ſee Heb. chaprer 5.12. Reade alſo Prou. 10.21. The lippes of the righteous feed many. And chap. 15.7. The lippes of the wiſe do ſpread abroad knowledge, and chapter 16. verſe 21.23.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, reade Prou. chap. 12.8. A man ſhall be commended for his wiſedome. Reade alſo chap. 31.18. &amp;c. But in this point diuerſe cautions are to be obſerued. Our praiſe muſt not be exceſſiue, nor to flatter the party; but to the glory of God, and to prouoke other to holy imitation. We muſt ſo praiſe that which is good in any, as we muſt diſlike and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that which is amiſſe, reade 1. Cor. 11.2. and verſe 17. &amp;c. and Reuel. chap. 2. and chap. 3.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:182:129"/>
            <p>For the third point, reade 1. Cor. 13.5.6.7. Loue thinketh not euill, &amp;c. It ſuffereth all things, it beleeueth all things, it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all things, it endureth all things.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Matth. 7.1. where raſh iudging is forbidden, as hath bene declared before in the negatiue part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>For the laſt point, reade Prou. 10.12. Loue couereth all treſpaſſes. And chap. 11.13. He that goeth about as a ſlaunderer (or detracter) diſcouereth a ſecret: but he that is of a faithfull heart concealeth a matter. And chap. 17.9. He that couereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh loue: but he that repeateth a matter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth his chiefe friend. Reade alſo chap. 25.9. and Matth. 18.15.16. and 1. Pet. 4.8.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the duties ſeruing to the procuring and preſeruing of our neighbours good name and welfare.</p>
            <p>It followeth that you ſhew which be the duties comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the recouery thereof, when by any manifeſt fall into ſome grieuous ſinne or other, both his name and the comfort of his whole eſtate is loſt, or at the leaſt greatly impaired.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſe, louing, and zealous reproofe and perſwaſions, drawne from the word of God, by our ſelues apart: and if that will not ſerue, by the further helpe and aſſiſtance of other good and louing neighbors, till happily he may be brought to repentance, and to ſeeke reconciliation, both with God and his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade for this Leuit. 19.17. reade alſo Matth. 5.23. &amp;c. and againe chap. 18 16.17. Iames 5.19.20.</p>
            <p>Of ſeeking reconciliation, we haue an example in Iobs friends, chap. 42. of that booke, verſe 8.</p>
            <p>But in ſo much as by reaſon of the ſtubburnneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a very hard thing for fleſh and bloud to ſtoop to any reproofe, and to take profit by it: and ſeeing in regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as you anſwered) great wiſedome is requiſite to the well ordering thereof, to the end it may take due effect, according as we reade Prou. 11.30. He that winneth ſoules is wiſe. I would haue you therefore call to remembrance, and ſhew what is required to the due ordering of reproofe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the quality and degree of the ſinne is to be conſidered.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:182:130"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the quality and diſpoſition of the offender is to be regarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, choiſe is to be made of the moſt fit and conuenient time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, loue, pity, and compaſſion ouer the offender, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his repentance to ſaluation, muſt be ioyned with zeale of Gods glory, and hatred of the ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt conſideration muſt be, whether the ſinne be ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or greater, either in it ſelfe and of the owne nature, or by circumſtance: whether it be committed of infirmity, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: once, or more often, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration muſt be, whether the offender be of a meeke, or of a more ſtirring and ſtubburne nature: old or young: whether a priuate or publike perſon, &amp;c. for age and authority muſt be reuerenced, &amp;c. reade 1. Tim. 5.1.2.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas ſome muſt be more mildly dealt withall, others muſt be more ſharpely rebuked: according both to the Commandement of God, and alſo according to the practiſe of his wiſe and faithfull ſeruants. For the Commandement, reade Gal. 6.1. Tit. 1.13. and chap. 3.10. and 1. Theſ. 5.14. and 2. Theſ. 3.14.15. and Iude, verſes 22.23. and Iſa. 58.1. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſee how the Apoſtle Paule moderateth his reproofe toward the Corinthians, 1. Epiſt. chap. 1. and chap. 4.21. and chap. 5. and chap. 11. compared alſo with Nathans maner of dealing with king Dauid in his reproofe, 2. Sam. 12. with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels dealing in the reproofe of Saule, 1. Sam. 15. Compare likewiſe Peters reprouing of Simon Magus, Acts 8.20. &amp;c. with his reprouing of Cornelius, Acts 10. and Paules repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Elymas the forcerer, Acts 13.9. &amp;c. and of Hymeneus and Alexander, 1. Tim. 1.20. with his reprouing of Peter, Gal. 2. Reade alſo chapter 3.1. and compare it with his precept, chap. 6.1. Reade alſo Ieremies practiſe, chap. 2.10.11. and the reſt of the Prophets. Loue and compaſſion ouer ſinners, muſt moderate and ſeaſon all reproofe.</p>
            <p>Reproofe muſt be as an electuary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the mildneſſe or ſweetneſſe of the one delaying the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or bitterneſſe of the other, that there may be a kindly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: for otherwiſe there is danger, leaſt it ſhould rather
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:182:130"/> inflame and poiſon, then ſupple and heale.</p>
            <p>The third conſideration muſt be for the fitneſſe of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnder the which alſo falleth the regard of a fit place. For if the offender ſhould be in his vnruly paſſions, and among his coapmates (as we may ſay) who would be ready to animate him, &amp;c. the reproofe (I ſpeake of priuate reproofe) ſhould then be vnſeaſonable. Reade Matth. 7.6.</p>
            <p>Such a time therefore is rather to be waited, and as it were picked out, when the bold ſinner may be ſingled alone, and when he may be found in a more ſeaſonable te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per. And chiefly if God ſo prouide, that he may be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled by ſome ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the ſame or the like ſinne. Or after the hearing of ſome zealous &amp; piercing Sermon, let not the occaſion be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. To this purpoſe marke the wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prophet Daniel, in giuing his reproofe &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel to Nebuchadnezzar, after that he was ſomewhat skared by his ſtrange dreame, chap. 4. Reade alſo 2. Chron. 19.2. how the Prophet Hananie is directed by the Spirit of God, to take the occaſion to reproue Iehoſhaphat vpon his late eſcaping of a great danger. Reade alſo 1. Sam. 19.1.2.3.4.5.6. how Ionathan choſe his time to deale with the king his father, in the behalfe of his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Dauid. And ch. 25. verſ. 36.37. how Abigail waiteth her ſeaſon to deale with her chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh husband N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bal. Thus therfore it ſtandeth vs in hand euery way to be very circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect, in the well ordering of reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The diſcretion of a man (ſaith King Salomon) differreth his anger, and it is his glory to paſſe by an offence, Prou. 19.11.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, he that will reproue as he ought, muſt moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently take heed, that he be carefull to reforme himſelfe firſt, Matth. 7.3.4.5. and then that he preſume not aboue his gifts, or his place and calling, by medling with matters aboue his reach, or with perſons of whom he may eaſily conceiue that they will ſcorne his admonition. Reade Prou. 9.8.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, it muſt there withall be conſidered alſo, that the wiſeſt of Gods ſeruants, cannot alwayes obſerue the time ſo fitly, nor carry the reproofe in ſo conuenient and due manner, but they muſt make reckening, that ſome of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (whom of loue and duty they ſhall admoniſh and rebuke) will harden their harts againſt the ſame: yea, and render hard
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:182:131"/> meaſure, againſt thoſe that ſhall moſt louingly reproue them. As Herod dealt againſt Iohn Baptiſt, caſting him into priſon. Reade Prou. 27.22. Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a foole in a morter, &amp;c. yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him.</p>
            <p>It is true, that a wiſe reprouer is as a golden eare-ring, and an ornament of fine gold: but he is ſo, onely to a wiſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient eare, Prou. 25.12. For compaſſion ouer the offender, beſide that Iude verſe 22. reade alſo Pſal. 119. verſe 136. Ier. 9.1. &amp;c. 2. Cor. chap. 12.12. Phil. chap. 3.18. Ioſh. 7.19.</p>
            <p>Thus much therefore for the witneſſing of the truth, and tendring our neighbours good name and welfare, may ſuffice for this time. Remembring alwayes, that in ſo much as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth truth to be witneſſed for the benefit of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſpecially, of our good and godly neighbour; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch caſes, wherein by the declaration of ſome truth, our neighbour ſhould be vniuſtly preiudiced &amp; hurt, we are at no hand to diſcloſe it. As for example, we muſt not betray our good neighbor and Chriſtian brother into the hands of cruell perſecutors, much leſſe the whole congregation, if we ſhould be examined of the time and place of their ſecret meetings for the worſhipping of God, and for their owne mutuall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And thus now we haue ſeene at the laſt (according to the meaſure of grace which God in mercy hath vouchſafed vpon vs) what our whole duty is toward our neighbour, according to this ninth Commandement.</p>
            <p>But is there nothing commanded, or at the leaſt neceſſarily implied in it concerning our ſelues, and the tendring of our owne good name and ſafety?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes: for by the duties which the Lord God commandeth vs toward other, he giueth vs to vnderſtand vvhat regard vve ought to haue of our ſelues and our owne good name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What regard is that which you ſpeake of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As we muſt truly repent of all our ſinnes paſt in the ſight of God, and make outward profeſſion of our repentance before men, touching thoſe ſinnes eſpecially, whereby we haue giuen offence to any, either publikly or priuately: ſo, for all time to come, it is our parts ſo to order our liues in vnfained obedience to all the holy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:182:131"/> Lawes and Commandements of God, that we may not only haue praiſe with God, &amp; the teſtimony of euery good neighbor, for our credit and welfare in the middeſt of them. Yet ſo, as we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for our owne parts, both thinke humbly, &amp; ſpeake modeſtly of our ſelues, &amp; our owne actions or vertues, according to that admonition of the holy Prou. cha.</hi> 27.2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth, a ſtranger and not thine owne lips. And Gal.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Let vs not be deſirous of vaine-glory, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for firſt the onely way to win or recouer a good name, is by amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our liues, wherein we haue tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; ſo procured our owne reproch: &amp; if we ſhall harken to the admonition &amp; rebuke of others, as well we as would haue any in the like caſe harken vnto vs &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, that euery man ſtandeth bound to haue care to ſeeke a good name in the Church of God, by walking hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the wayes &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God, we may conſider it by diuerſe reaſons. For the waies of God are the only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable waies. Feare God, &amp; keepe his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements (ſaith the preacher, Eccl. cha. 12. ver. 13.) for this is all of a man. All what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beſide is vanity. And what elſe in any ſound reaſon can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be worthily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for, if he want the feare of God, &amp;c.

The Lord himſelf maketh the faith of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their good name, Heb. 11.39. &amp; their obedience the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof. Reade Phil. 4.8. In this reſpect, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the whole Law of God beareth the name of truth; to the obedience whereof alſo is oppoſed the generall vice of lying, as Pſa. 119. verſe 29. Take away from me the way of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſaith the holy Prophet) and of thy good grace graunt me thy Law. And verſe 89. All the Commandements of God are truth. And Pſal. 19.9. The iudgements of the Lord are truth: whereupon alſo ſaith the Apoſtle Iohn, 1. Epiſt. 1.9. If we ſay we haue fellowſhip with God and walke in darkeneſſe, we lye, and do not truly. And chap. 2.4. He that faith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a lyer, and the truth is not in him. Thus, Rom. 1.25. Idolaters are ſaid to turne the truth of God into a lye, and Iames chapter 3.14.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:182:132"/>
            <p>They that haue bitter enuying and ſtrife in their hearts, they are lyers againſt the truth. On the contrary, he that doth truth, commeth to the light that his workes might be made manifeſt, that they are wrought according to God, Iohn 3.21. Such are ſayd to walke in the truth, Iohn 2. Epiſt. verſe 4. and Epiſtle 3. verſes 3.4. euen that truth which is according to godlineſſe, Titus. 1.1. euen that truth which is in Chriſt Ieſus, Epheſ. 4.12. and for the which we muſt do all that we can; and nothing againſt it, 2. Cor. 13.8. for the which we muſt not onely be witneſſes, but euen Martyrs in a ſpeciall manner, if need ſo require.</p>
            <p>And a particular branch of this obedience from whence a good name is argued, is the ſpeaking and witneſſing of the truth, according to this ninth Commandement. And when a man is a man of his word, as they ſay; and when (as our Sauior Chriſt ſpeaketh) his yea is yea, and his nay nay; and when we be carefull to auoide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus muſt we walke, that we may haue praiſe both before God and man: reade Rom. 2.28.29. But that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point of our treatiſe: What is to be ſayd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſecret ſinnes: do we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd bound to make them knowne, as being a meanes whereby God would haue vs ſeeke a good name?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As God requireth it for a duty of loue to our neighbour, that we diſcouer not his ſecret ſinnes, either before the Magistrate or otherwiſe; that is to ſay, thoſe his ſins, by the concealing whereof no perill or hurt groweth to the common-wealth, or to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and priuate neighbour: ſo he permitteth it as a fruite of loue belonging to a mans ſelfe, that he ſhould not to his owne dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, diſcloſe his like ſecret offences: vnleſſe happily he ſhould find it neceſſary, for the reliefe of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowne to ſome choiſe &amp; faithfull neighbor, according to the inſtruction of the Apoſtle, Iam. cha.</hi> 5.16. <hi>ſaying: Acknowledge your faults one to another, &amp; pray one for another, that ye may be healed: for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtandeth with good reaſon. For as no man will make
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:182:132"/> knowne his bodily diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The Equitie.</note> to that Phiſition which would haue no care to do him good: ſo what ſhould induce a man to acknowledge his faults to any that would not tender the ſpirituall health of their ſoules, &amp;c? Hereupon alſo it may appeare, that the law of Popiſh auricular confeſſion of all ſinnes, both ſecret and open, to the full number, in the eare of the Prieſt, to receiue his iniunction of pennance in way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God, is an abſurd and tyrannous cruelty againſt mens ſoules and conſciences.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe their oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> driuing men to accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, according to the pleaſure of any mans captious inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and demand: it is againſt that gracious liberty which God hath graunted to his ſeruants in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>And for any to diſcouer his owne ſecret corruptions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt cauſe, and not to ſingular good ende and purpoſe, would it not be iudged of all, to be done either of hypocriſie, or of a prophane and vnaduiſed follie?</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, if any keeping cloſe his ſinnes, do harden his hart therein, he may iuſtly feare, leaſt God in his diſpleaſure, do make him in the terror of a helliſh conſcience, to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe, and to be a trumpet of his owne ſhame, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it falleth out againſt ſuch cloſe &amp; hard harted ſinners.</p>
            <p>But enough of this point for the preſent: We come now to the generall equity of this Commandement.</p>
            <p>What is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The equity of this Commandement may be conſidered diuerſe wayes, like as we haue ſeene in the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew here againe how that may be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in reſpect of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in reſpect of our ſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, in reſpect of our more priuate and vſuall courſe of dealing with our neighbours and brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, in reſpect of publike ſociety and gouernement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, in reſpect of our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the name &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs examine theſe things particularly.</p>
            <p>And firſt how can ye declare the equity of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in reſpect of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe he is the God of truth, moſt entire, faithful &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:182:133"/> all truth: it is moſt quall, that he ſhould forbid his people all vntruth, as that vvhich is moſt directly contrary, both to his nature and vvill, and alſo to all his counſels, vvordes, and vvorkes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your anſwer is moſt true, whether we conſider of God in the vnity of his nature, he is the God of truth, Ieremie 10.10. Or whether we conſider of him as he hath reuealed himſelfe in the Trinity of perſons. The father is the father of truth, Iohn 5.30.31. and chapter 8.26.27. The ſonne of God is true, yea, truth it ſelfe, Prouerbs 8.6.7.8. Iohn chapter 1.9. The holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of truth, Iohn. 14.15.16.17. and chapter 16.13. and 1. Iohn chapter 5. verſe 6. And in the ſame place, verſes 7.8.9.10. The ioynt witneſſe of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is true from heauen.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo it is, that the word of God is called in a ſingular and incomparable excellency, the word of truth, 2. Cor. 6. verſe 7. and Tit. 1.9. the faithfull word, and Iames 1.18.</p>
            <p>The counſels and purpoſes of God are all faithfull and true, Hoſh. chapter 13 verſe 14. Rom. 11.29. 1. Cor. 1.9. 1. Theſ. 5.24. Iames 1.17. Pſal. 105<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe 8. and Pſal. 14.6. All the works of God alſo are perfect and true: they are not counterfeites of things, but true ſubſtances of things, in their ſeuerall kinds, Deut. 32.4. and Pſal. 112.7.8. and Pſalme 119.90.91.7.</p>
            <p>God therefore being euery way moſt true, muſt needs in all equity command both true ſpeaking and true dealing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his owne nature.</p>
            <p>Proceed now to declare likewiſe the equity of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, in reſpect of our ſelues.</p>
            <p>How may we perceiue this to be ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſomuch as God hath ſhewed ſo great loue on vs, that vve ſhould be called his children; it is very equall and meete, that we ſhould reſemble the image of our heauenly father, in all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſſe of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeed do the Apoſtles of the Lord reaſon, 1. Iohn 3.1. &amp;c. and Paul Epheſ. 4.24. Yea ſuch are their very words. Reade alſo Col. 3.9.10.</p>
            <p>Now verily ſuch muſt we be, vnleſſe we wil ſhew our ſelues to be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuel, &amp; not the children of God, Ioh. 8.44.</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:182:133"/>
            <p>But let vs come to the third point.</p>
            <p>How can you ſhew the equitie of this Commandement, in reſpect of our more priuate and vſuall courſe of dealing with our neighbours and brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt off lying (ſaith the Apostle) and ſpeake euerie man the truth vnto his neighbour: fer we are members one of another, Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>A notable and liuely ſimilitude taken from the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to the which God hath giuen diuerſe members, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie faculties and powers vnto them, and all for the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole bodie.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, were it not an vnequall and a very abſurd courſe, that any one member ſhould deale vnfaithfully with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? as if the eye ſhould take chalke for cheeſe, as we ſay: or the hand to put a ſtone to the mouth in ſtead of bread, or ranke poiſon in ſtead of wholeſome nouriſhment?</p>
            <p>No leſſe abſurd were lying in the new work of Gods grace, then that ſhould be in the frame of nature: whether one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould ly to another, or that they ſhould tell lyes the one of the other.</p>
            <p>Now fourthly, how can you declare the equitie of this Commaundement, in reſpect of publike ſocietie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ordinarie courſe of iuſtice and iudgement cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede for the defence of the innocent, and puniſhment of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, neither yet for the ending of controuerſies betwixt good neighbors, but by the testimonie of witneſſes; and that alſo, euen vpon their othes, for the more certainty of finding out the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for as the Lord ſaith, Deut. 19.15. At the mouth of two witneſſes, or at the mouth of three witneſſes ſhall the matter be eſtabliſhed. Reade alſo Matth. 18.16. and 2. Cor. 13. which places alſo were mentioned a litle before. And againe, Hebr. 6.16. An oth for confirmation is with men an end of all ſtrife.</p>
            <p>It ſtandeth therefore with all equitie, that euerie man ſhold be willing according to his knowledge, in a due courſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie, to giue witneſſe to the truth: yea it is euerie mans part, carefully to obſerue and marke thoſe things which it is fit for
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:182:134"/> them to know,<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note> that they may (as occaſion ſhall require) be meet witneſſes of the truth.</p>
            <p>It is not a ſufficient excuſe for a man to ſay, I know not what to ſay to it, wheras he might haue known if he had liſted. Euen as we would gladly haue the iuſt teſtimonie of others, for the clearing of our ſelues, &amp;c. ſo ought we to be willing to yeeld ours for the benefite of other. And likewiſe, as we would be loth that ſo precious a iewell as a good name is, and that ſo ſweete a fruit, as is louing fauour which groweth from thence, ſhould be ſtolen as it were out of our gardens by any falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lyes, and ſlaunders: ſo ought we of the ſame equitie, to take heede that we defraude not or ſpoile anie of their good name and eſtimation, by the ſame vniuſt &amp; wicked practiſes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the equitie of this point appeareth, in ſo much as falſe witneſſe, lying and ſlaundering, is the common harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and vpholder of all ſinnes, and alſo an enemie to all vertue and godlineſſe, both in deprauing thereof, and alſo in denying all iuſt defence and ſuccour thereunto. We are come to the laſt point.</p>
            <p>How can you ſhew the equitie of this Commaundement in reſpect of our profeſſion of the name and religion of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe they that ſlaunder and defame any their good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and brethren, and they alſo themſelues, who walke not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their profeſſion, do giue occaſion to the enemies of Gods true religion, to blaſpheme and ſpeake euill of the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reuerend name of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is ſaid indeed of king Dauid, that by his grieuous ſinne of adulterie and murther, he cauſed the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, 2. Sam. 12.14. And more generally it is ſaid of the wicked Iewes, that through their breaking of Gods Law, they diſhonoured God, and that through them the name of God was blaſphemed among the Gentiles: Rom. 2.23.24. Now ſurely, this is the moſt vnequall thing that can be, that God who honoureth his people with putting his name vpon them, and in calling them to the profeſſion of his heauenly kingdome and glorie: it is the moſt vnequall thing that may be (I ſay) that God ſhould be diſhonoured by them. Ought ye not (ſaith that honourable Nehemiah, chap. 5.9.) to walke in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:182:134"/> the feare of God for the reproch of the heathen our enemies? So the equitie of this Commandement and of the third, is in this reſpect the ſame. And the rather alſo is it vnequall, that one Chriſtian ſhould ſlaunder an other; becauſe the enemies of Gods truth are ouer readie, to ſeeke the diffamation and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of vs all, though we be carefull to maintaine the credit one of another, ſo much as in truth and equitie we may.</p>
            <p>The equitie of this Commaundement being thus manifold and great, no maruell though God in his iuſtice hath threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and aſsigned ſo manie and great curſes or plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to the tranſgreſsions of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe curſes therefore let vs now come vnto: for this is the place, wherein we are according to our order to conſider of them.</p>
            <p>And firſt, what is the curſe and puniſhment of thoſe that beare falſe witneſſe vpon their oth before a Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The puniſhment of ſuch in the ciuill courſe of Gods iuſtice, vvas appointed to be the ſame, vvhich they by their falſe vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vvould haue brought vpon their neighbour, as we reade in the</hi> 19. <hi>chap. of Deut. from the</hi> 16. <hi>verſe to the end of the chap. And Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>and</hi> 19. <hi>ſuch as are instruments of wrong this way, they are by the conſent of the people of God, euen according to his commaundement, pronounced accurſed before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So indeed we read expreſly in thoſe places of holy Scripture: and there is no doubt, that God who commaundeth ciuill Iudges to vſe this ſeueritie againſt the bodies and outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of falſe witneſſes, will be behind in the execution of his diuine iuſtice, both vpon their bodies and alſo vpon their ſouls, whoſoeuer ſhall not haue grace to repent them earneſtly of ſo great and grieuous a ſinne.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding the courſe of ciuill iuſtice among vs, is more ſlacke then that of the Lords in Iſraell and by ſomuch more failing and vnperfect then that was: yet it is no ſmall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or curſe and reproch, that the periured perſon is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from the credite of giuing teſtimonie in anie matter of iudgement ſo long as he liueth.</p>
            <p>And further alſo, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the more heauy curſe againſt the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:182:135"/> falſe witneſſe, reade Prou. 19.5. and in the ſame chapter, verſ. 28.29. And againe, chap. 21. verſe 28. where the often repetition argueth the ſpeciall diſpleaſure of God againſt this ſinne, as againſt that which is greatly abhorred of him: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we reade, Prou. 6.19. and Pſalm. 59. from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 11. verſe: where, reade a fearefull imprecation againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſon.</p>
            <p>And thus we may by very plentifull and authentick witneſſe perceiue, that the falſe witneſſe ſhall be ſurely and ſeuerely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Now, what is the curſe againſt the wicked iudge or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who ſhall without diligent ſifting of the falſe witneſſe, admit and allow his falſe teſtimonie, and accordingly giue a wrong ſentence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ſaith to the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, and the multitude ſhall abhorre him, Prou.</hi> 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>yea, the Lord himſelfe doth abhorre him, Prou.</hi> 17.15.</p>
            <p>How then ſhould he not ſtand fearefully accurſed? Reade alſo Prou. 29.12. Such a prince muſt needs make wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and ſo haſte the curſe of God againſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt the common and vnconſcionable lyer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue partly ſeene it in the curſe of the falſe witneſſe; from the teſtimonies of diuerſe holy Pro. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rehearſed. And we may ſee it further, Prou. chap.</hi> 12.19. <hi>The lying tong ſhall ſoone vaniſh, the deceit of ſuch ſhall turne to their owne hurt: according to that which followeth there in the next verſe. And in the ſame chapter, the</hi> 22. <hi>verſe: Lying lippes are an abhomination to the Lord. Wherefore alſo it is written, Pſalm.</hi> 5. <hi>the</hi> 6. <hi>verſe: The Lord will deſtroy them that ſpeake lies. And Reuel.</hi> 21.8. <hi>All lyers ſhall haue their part in that lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reade alſo Reuel. chap. 22. verſe 15. and Pſalm. 31.18. a vehement imprecation againſt lyers: and namely againſt that doggiſh Doeg, Pſalm. 52.3.4.5.</p>
            <p>Among men alſo, this is a iuſt recompence againſt the lyer from the hand of God; that he ſhall not be beleeued though he ſpeake the truth.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:182:135"/>
            <p>And finally note, that as the ſinne of lying is increaſed by common ſwearing, ſo alſo ſhall the curſe be the more heauie againſt ſuch. Reade here againe Zacharie 5.4.</p>
            <p>But let vs haſt forward.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt the priuie and malicious backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter and ſlaunderer, &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 140. <hi>in the</hi> 9. <hi>verſe thus we reade: Backebyters ſhall not be eſtabliſhed vpon the earth, euill ſhall hunt the cruell man to deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, and by that which we reade in the 15. Pſalme, we may perceiue that this ſin is as a barre againſt all ſuch, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>And beſide, by that we reade, Pſalm. 101. verſe 5. we may ſee they are ſuch a kind of people, as are not to be ſuffered in a godly family or Chriſtian common wealth.</p>
            <p>And further, concerning the ciuill puniſhment of the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer in the common wealth of Iſraell, to wit, in the caſe of the ſlaunder of a virgin touching her virginitie, reade Deuter. chap. 22. verſe 13. &amp;c. to the 19. verſe.</p>
            <p>Thus then the curſe is great againſt falſe witneſſes, lyers and ſlaunderers.</p>
            <p>Is there anie curſe alſo againſt them that conceale that truth which of dutie they ought to diſcloſe and vtter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſaid of ſuch, that they ſhall beare their iniquitie, Leuit. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>the</hi> 1. <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſurely, if iniquitie be vpon them, the puniſhment will follow, if it be not preuented by repentance, and by humble ſupplication to God for the pardon and forgiueneſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But let vs proceede.</p>
            <p>What is the curſe againſt him that doth diſcouer the ſecrets of his neighbour, which he ought of loue and faithfulneſſe to haue concealed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that dealeth thus, ſhall worthily looſe his chiefe friend: according to that we reade, Prou.</hi> 17. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>He that couereth a tranſgreſſion ſeeketh loue, but he that repeateth a matter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth the Prince. And chapter.</hi> 25.9.10. <hi>Debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with thy neighbour, and diſcouer not the ſecret to another, leaſt he that heareth put thee to ſhame, &amp; thine infamy ceaſe not.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:182:136"/>
            <p>Thus reproch is puniſhed by reproch.</p>
            <p>The curſe of him that flattereth and diſſembleth with his neighbour is yet behind: What proofe haue you that ſuch are accurſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The curſe (ſaith king Salomon) ſhall be imputed to him that bleſſeth his friend with a loud voice, riſing early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to do it, Prou.</hi> 27.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Iob, chap.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>The eyes of his children ſhall faile that ſpeaketh flatterie to his friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus, The eyes of thoſe that giue themſelues to flatter &amp; ſooth vp their friends, they ſhall faile.</p>
            <p>Such is the curſe of the flatterer, euen of ſuch who (as was ſaid before) riſe vp early to do it: as it is written of Abſolon that he did, 2. Sam. 15.2. Reade alſo Prou. 12.2.3.</p>
            <p>Now what is the curſe of him that raſhly miſ-iudgeth his neighbour, and miſ-conſtrueth his words and deeds, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in the worſt part?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudge not (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) that ye be not iudged: for with what iudgement ye iudge ye ſhall be iudged, and with what meaſure ye meat, it ſhal be meaſured to you, Mat.</hi> 7.1.2.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh of this no doubt, as of a iuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of God vpon all raſh iudgers. Wherfore ſeeing he thus ordereth the hearts of men, ſhall we not much rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he himſelfe will vſe ſeueritie of iudgement againſt ſuch rigorous cenſurers? What is the curſe againſt thoſe that refuſe to hearken to inſtruction, that ſo by leading a faithfull and godly life they might get them ſelues a good name?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The iuſt and due curſe hereof, is ſhame and reproch both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such indeed is the fruite of a licencious life, Prou. 5. verſes 12.13.14. and chap. 10.7. The name of the wicked ſhall rot. And chap. 13.18. Pouertie and ſhame is to him that refuſeth inſtruction. Read a fearefull imprecation in that reſpect, Pſal. 109.13.14.15. reade alſo Eccleſ. chap. 11.9.</p>
            <p>Shew likewiſe, what the curſe is againſt ſuch, as forſaking the wayes of God, refuſe to hearken to inſtruction &amp; rebuke, for the recouerie of a good name?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſtruction is euill to him that forſaketh the way: and he that

And thus we may alſo yet further perceiue, how the Lord accurſing all vntruth againſt a mans neighbor in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this life, muſt needs much rather hold thoſe accurſed which lye vnto himſelfe, or beare falſe witneſſe, more directly to the falſifying of the rruth of his diuine will and doctrine, to the ſpeciall diſhonour of his name, and to the perill of mens ſoules. Of the curſe of ſuch as lye vnto God, conſider from the example of Ananias and Sapphira, Act. 5.3.4.5. &amp;c. And of ſuch as ſpeake lyes, and teach falſe doctrin through hypocriſie: reade 1. Tim. 4.1.2.3. Reade alſo Deut. 13. and Ierem. 23. and chap. 28.15. Ezek. chap. 13. Reuel. chap. 19.20. and chap. 20.10. and chap. 22.18.19. Reade alſo Numb. 14.37. Thoſe men that did bring vp that vile ſlaunder vpon the land, ſhall dy by a plague before the Lord. But this conſideration doth more properly belong to the curſes againſt the tranſgreſsion of the firſt Table, where alſo it hath bene conſidered of.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore leaue this point, and come to the bleſsing which God hath promiſed to the obedience of this Comm.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, what is the bleſsing of the true and faithfull witneſſe before a Magiſtrate, as alſo of him that hath a general care to ſpeake the truth from the heart?</p>

               <hi>The Lord aſſureth all ſuch, that they are the true members of his Church here, and that they ſhall for euer reſt with him in his heauenly kingdome, and neuer be cast out or remoued, as we reade in the</hi> 15. <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſurely is an excellent Scripture, moſt comfortable to the purpoſe, as we haue lately heard from the ſermons made vpon it. Read alſo Prou. 12.19. and verſe 22. and chap. 21. verſ. 28. Shew in the next place, what the bleſsing of ſuch Iudges and Magiſtrates is, whoſoeuer be truely carefull to examine witneſſes diligently, that according to a true teſtimonie they may iudge truely?</p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:182:137"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercie and truth preſerue the King: as we reade Prou.</hi> 20.28. <hi>and chap.</hi> 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.26. <hi>To them that rebuke the wicked ſhall be pleaſure, and vpon them ſhall come the bleſſing of euerie good man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhall kiſſe the lips of him that anſwereth vpright words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are three notable bleſſings bound vp as it were a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold cord twined together: The ſafetie of the eſtate of the king in his princely royaltie: Much inward ioy and comfort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, great pleaſure as it is called: And the louing and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ſubiection of the people, noted by their prayers to God for them, and by the kiſſing of their lippes, which are ſpeciall fruites and tokens of ſpeciall loue. Reade alſo Prou. 29.14.</p>
            <p>The bleſſing thus promiſed to the King as to the head and chiefetaine of the common wealth, deſcendeth no doubt vpon euerie inferiour Magiſtrate, as vpon other principall members of the publike bodie.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, that we may go forward: what is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him that is ſo farre from falſe witneſſe bearing, lying &amp; ſlaundering, flatterie, and euill ſuſpitions without iuſt cauſe; that contrariwiſe he is of a charitable iudgement, louing and tendering the good name &amp; eſtimation of euerie good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, deſiring that it may continue and proſper without all preiudice, either in his owne heart, or in the opinion of anie other.</p>
            <p>What I ſay is the bleſſing of euerie ſuch man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed (ſaith the holy Pſalmiſt) is he that iudgeth wiſely of the poore, ſaying: The Lord will deliuer him in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And ſo foorth, as it followeth from the beginning of the</hi> 41. <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This charitable iudgement which the holy Prophet ſpeaketh of, is the ground and foundation of much truth in ſpeech, and as a ſtrong fortreſſe againſt all lying and ſlaundering.</p>
            <p>And therefore alſo doth our Sauiour Chriſt aſſure all ſuch of like recompence, at the hands of all other good and well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and charitable minded men: Iudge not (ſaith he) and ye ſhall not be iudged: condemne not, and ye ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: forgiue, and ye ſhall be forgiuen. Luke chap. 6.37.</p>
            <p>We will haſt forward.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:182:137"/>
            <p>What is the bleſsing of them that will hearken to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and counſell of ſuch as teach and inſtruct them in the wayes of God, that ſo they may haue a good name; which ſurely ought of all the children of God to be greatly deſired and laboured after: What is the bleſsing of ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let not mercie and truth forſake thee, (ſaith king Salomon) bind them vpon thy necke, and vvrite them vpon the table of thine heart. So ſhalt thou find fauour and good vnderſtanding (or as ſome tranſlate, proſperous ſucceſſe) in the ſight of God and man, Prouerbes chapter</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. <hi>and chapter,</hi> 10.17. <hi>He that regardeth inſtruction is in the way of life. And in the ſame chap. verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The memoriall of the iuſt ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to ſay, the remembrance of ſuch as walke in the righteous wayes of God, ſhall be gracious and acceptable in the Church of God, both while they liue, and alſo after their death. It ſhall be a continuall occaſion of prayſing God, and a ſpurre to ſtirre vp other to imitation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, earneſt is that often repeated exhortation, wherein the holy Ghoſt moueth to the obedience of holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Prou. 1.8.9. And againe chap. 4 13. likewiſe chap. 6.20. and verſe 23. And yet againe, chap. 7.2. and chap. 8.10. and verſe 33. and alſo chap. 13. verſe 14. and verſe 18. He that regardeth correction ſhall be honoured. And is there not a bleſsing alſo for thoſe that haue care to teach &amp; inſtruct others to walke in the gracious and commendable waies of the Lord: that ſo they may haue fauour both with God and man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yes very great, according to the excellencie of this dutie in the ſight of God, and according to the greatnes of the bleſſing which hereby they procure vnto their brethren: as we may reade, Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>and in the end of the Epiſtle of the Apoſtle Iames. Whereof alſo we haue Abigail for a liuely example.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam. chap.</hi> 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> 32.33.</p>
            <p>Let vs for example ſake, and to the end that by a particular inſtance the matter may be the more cleare: let vs (I ſay) heare the bleſsing which Dauid in this reſpect put vpon Abigail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed (ſaith the Prophet Dauid) be the Lord God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, who hath ſent thee this day to meete me. And bleſſed be thy counſell, and bleſſed be thou, vvho hast kept me this day from
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:182:138"/> comming to ſhed bloud, and that mine hand hath not ſaued me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a notable inſtance, and may well ſerue for our iſſue and concluſion of this point.</p>
            <p>And thus, we hauing through the gracious bleſsing of God, the whole interpretation of this Commaundement, touching the euils forbidden and the vertues commaunded: touching the curſes againſt the one, and the bleſsings vpon the other, let vs now come to the vſe.</p>
            <p>Haue you pefectly obeyed this 9. Commaundement, that ſo you may thinke your ſelfe worthie to be freed from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to be partaker of the bleſsings of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No: I haue no more perfectly obeyed this Commaundement then any of the former, but I haue euerie way ſinned againſt it, partly through ignorance and forgetfulneſſe of the truth in many matters, which I ought to haue knowne and remembred: and partly for want of loue both vnto the truth, and alſo to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but much more by reaſon of that hatred and enuie which aboundeth in my corrupt nature. For hence is it, that I haue bene ſo far from ſpeaking the truth alwaies, &amp; giuing a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all things concerning my neighbour; that vpon euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vnkindnes &amp; diſpleaſure, I haue bene readie to deny him his due praiſe, yea to ſpeake all euill of him, and to inuent all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lyes and ſlaunders againſt him. Moreouer, as I am readie to accuſe and blame thoſe whom I account my foes, falſly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that there is iuſt cauſe, ſo am I apt to flatter ſuch as I take to be my friends: and againe to make vntrue excuſes and partiall defences for my ſelfe, to all thoſe of whom I ſtand in any feare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, I am by my naturall diſpoſition ſo far from amending my faults when I am reproued, that of wilfull ſtubburnneſſe I wil rather do the worſe, becauſe I am reproued for them. Wherfore I must needs acknowledge, that I am ſo farre from worthineſſe to enioy the bleſſing of this Commaundement, that I haue iuſtly deſerued all the curſes of it, vnleſſe it ſhall pleaſe God of his free grace &amp; bounteous mercie for Chriſt Ieſus ſake, to forgiue theſe my grieuous ſins, &amp; to giue me grace vnfainedly to repent of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true which you anſwer concerning euerie one of vs; yea concerning all the ſonnes and daughters of men, through the whole race of mankind. For thus the holy Prophet of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:182:138"/> Pſalm. 58.3. and Pſalm. 62.9. Reade alſo Pſalm. 116.11. and Rom. 3.4. Experience alſo ſheweth,<note place="margin">Eueryone of vs is a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſgreſſor</note> that all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are lyers, and that naturally we are more delighted with lyes then with the truth.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this vice appearing in childhood, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with age, vnleſſe God by his grace doth correct the ſame; as they haue plentifull experience, to whome the examination of malefactors appertaineth.</p>
            <p>And as we are altogether corrupt and ſinfull in lying all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lyes, both earneſt lyes, merrie lyes, and officious lyes; in cunning excuſes in falſe accuſations, &amp; in the root of all theſe, ſelfe loue, hatred and euill ſuſpitions: ſo are we as apt to flatter, and ſooth vp ſuch as we feare, or ſuch from whom we looke for benefit or preferment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And touching our obſtinacie againſt rebuke, is not euerie one readie to bewray the deepe corruption which lyeth lurking in his heart? I ſpeake of all ſuch as haue not yet receiued the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification. For do not ſuch vſe to ſay when they are perſwaded withall, by this reaſon of a good name: What care I what any man thinketh or ſpeaketh of me, let them ſay what they will, I care not a pinne, &amp;c? Thus rude and brutiſh is our naughtie nature. Who therefore may truely deny, that we are not through the corruption of nature, and becauſe of the euill fruites thereof againſt this Commaundement iuſtly accurſed &amp; damnable in the ſight of God?</p>
            <p>So then vnleſſe (as was anſwered) we ſhall find redemption and iuſtification by our Sauiour Chriſt, how many of vs all thinke to eſcape the eternall wrath and condemnation of God?</p>
            <p>It is therefore to great good purpoſe, that we conſider of ſome proofes, that may aſſure vs that our Sauiour Chriſt who hath dyed for theſe our ſinnes, as well as for any other, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo perfectly obeyed this Commandement, as well as he hath done the other, that ſo we may know him to be a perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. What proofe haue you for this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We haue euident proofe of it, in that it is euerie where in the holy Scriptures teſtified, that our Sauiour Chriſt is not onely true, but alſo the very truth it ſelf, to all that ſhall truly beleeue in him, and vnfainedly repent of all their errors, and thenceforth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:182:139"/> indeuour to mind and ſpeake the truth from their hearts:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our Sauiour Chriſts pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fect obedience for vs.</note> 
               <hi>For we know (ſaith the Apoſtle Iohn, ſpeaking of himſelfe and all true Chriſtians) that the Sonne of God is come, and hath giuen vs a mind to know him which is true: and we are in him that is true, that is, in his Sonne Ieſus Christ, he is very God and eternall life,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p>This onely one place is a ſufficient proofe: but as was truly aunſwered, we haue many other teſtimonies, both former in that part of the holy Scriptures which is called the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and later in that part which is called the new. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we reade Prou. chap. 8. verſ. 6.7.8. and Iſa. chap. 11.1. Concerning the later, we reade Reu. 3.7. and verſ. 14 More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, Iohn 1.6.14. and chap. 5.19.24. and in manie other places: where the manner of our Sauiour Chriſt his deliuerie of his doctrine with this doubled aſſeueration, verily, verily, is worthie to be noted to this our purpoſe. Neither is Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt onely a witneſſe, that our Sauiour Chriſt is the truth, verſes 32.33. of the ſame chap. but alſo God the father himſelf, and the diuine works which our Sauiour Chriſt wrought in his Fathers name: as it followeth in the ſame chap. verſ. 36.37. &amp; verſ. 39. The holy Scriptures giue the ſame witneſſe of him. And more particularly the writings of Moſes, verſe 46. Reade alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the teſtimonie which our Sauiour giueth of himſelfe, Ioh. chap. 14.6. and chap. 8.14.15.16.17.18. &amp; verſ. 45.46.</p>
            <p>Thus then, ſeeing our Sauiour Chriſt (to ſpeake in the moſt generall ſignification of all truth) is moſt true, yea in himſelfe euen the moſt excellent and perfect truth it ſelfe, yea and vnto vs the way, the truth, and the life: and ſeeing the Father, from whence our Sauiour Chriſt is come, who is the God of truth, and the holy Ghoſt alſo, who is the Spirit of truth, giue witnes of Chriſt, that he is very truth: what letteth why we ſhould not aſſure our ſelues, that he is true in the particular obedience of this Commandement: yea what letteth that we ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that he hath perfectly obeyed this Commandement, as well as he is perfectly iuſt in the obedience of the 8. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; and chaſt in the obedience of the 7. and meeke in the obedience of the 6. and dutifull to parents and to all ſuperiors in the obedience of the 5. And the rather becauſe our Sauiour
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:182:139"/> Chriſt profeſſeth that this was the cauſe, why he came into the world, that he might giue witneſſe to the truth for the benefit of ſo many as ſhould receiue his teſtimonie thereof, Ioh. 18.37.</p>
            <p>In this Chriſt therefore muſt we beleeue, to the end that (we being lyers in our ſelues) may be true in him, and clothed with his righteouſneſſe touching this Commandement, as wel as with his obedience to all the reſt. For if we do not beleeue in this Chriſt (of whom it is teſtified that he is euerie way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly true) we cannot be ſaued, as Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth, Ioh. chap. 8.24. Except ye beleeue (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And finally, this alſo we muſt know, that if we be in Chriſt, we muſt of neceſsitie, or rather we ſhall by his grace, truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all the lyes and ſlaunders that we haue made; and of all other our tranſgreſsions againſt this Commaundement. Yea putting away all lying, &amp;c. we muſt haue vnfained care both to ſpeake and to do the truth, in ſome meaſure of true and perfect loue both to God and man; labouring alſo to increaſe more &amp; more therein. Read Philip. chap. 4.8. Let this ſuffice therfore for the vſe of the whole doctrine of this ninth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.</p>
            <p>And ſo come we now to the laſt, which is a moſt worthie concluſion of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe, thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet thy neighbours wife, nor his manſeruant, nor his maid, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, neither any thing that is thy neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the vnderſtanding of this laſt Commandement, beſides that we muſt keepe in mind that which was ſaid concerning the former Commandement, who is to be taken for our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; we haue furthermore to inquire of theſe two things: Firſt what the Lord meaneth by this word couet, that is, what be the euill corruptions and ſins of our nature comprehended vnder it. And ſecondly, which be the things of our neighbour which he forbiddeth vs to couet.</p>
            <p>Shew therfore in the firſt place, what the word couet meaneth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To couet, is to haue any the leaſt luſt, deſire, or motion in the mind, after any thing that is our neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord hath forbidden coueting or longing, with all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull deſire after any thing that is our neighbors, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:182:140"/> going before.<note place="margin">How it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> For in the 8. Commaundment he hath forbidden vs to couet our neighbours houſe, or any part of his worldly riches: In the 7. Commaundement he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden vs to couet or luſt after our neighbours wife, &amp;c. as our Sauiour Chriſt expoundeth that Commaundement in the 5. chap. of Matthew. Yea this corrupt coueting or Iuſting, this longing after, deſiring or wiſhing (for all theſe are one) it is as it were a ſhort and ſummarie abridgement of all ſinne. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting or deſiring after diuine honour and glorie, that is, after any honour and glorie aboue that is meete for a creature; as Eue was tempted by the Diuell to deſire to be like God, it is the tranſgreſſion of the firſt Table.</p>
            <p>All coueting or luſting which tendeth to the hurt of our neighbour, is a generall tranſgreſſion of the ſecond Table.</p>
            <p>Coueting therefore or luſting, is as an vniuerſall leproſie or contagious poiſon ouerſpreading, or rather vndermining all good dutie. It may ſeeme therefore that this Commandement is nothing elſe but a repetition or interpretation of that which hath bene alreadie forbidden.</p>
            <p>How may this ſtand with the wiſedome of the moſt wiſe God, that he minding to ſet downe his Law moſt briefly ſhould forbid one and the ſame thing more then once?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This queſtion containeth in it ſelfe a full and ſufficient anſwer vnder it: for in ſo much as God is moſt wiſe and diſcreet, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the very author of all that diſtinction whereby any thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from other: we may in no wiſe thinke that he ſhould in ſo ſhort a Law as he gaue to his people, make any vnneceſſarie repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of one and the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true: God that hath made and diſpoſed all things moſt exactly, as it were by line, weight and meaſure, Iſa. 40.12.13.14. God who numbreth the ſtarres, and calleth them all by their names, Pſalm. 147.4. God that giueth man all the vnderſtanding and diſcretion which he hath to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt things that differ: he that taketh the wiſe in all their crafts and quirkes, &amp;c. ſhall not he know how to ſpeake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly? It followeth therefore, that we do neceſſarily make a diſtinction betwixt this coueting which is forbidden in this Commandement, and that which is forbidden in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:182:140"/> going before. What diſtinction may this be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the former Commaundements all coueting is forbidden, to the vvhich conſent is giuen. Here coueting is forbidden in the leaſt motion, though no conſent be yeelded at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea the leaſt flitting and vagrant motion which hath neuer ſo litle delight mixed with it. And not onely ſo, but alſo the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, vain, and looſe thought, of the vniuſt enioying of any thing that is our neighbours, which our Sauiour Chriſt ſeemeth to call diſcourſing in the ayer, Luke 12.29. yea euen the verie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall inclination of our corrupt nature to anie vnrighteous luſt and deſire is forbidden, albeit there ariſe no motion or any the leaſt delight therewithall. And therefore much rather doth the Lord forbid all continued conſultation and deliberation of the heart, tending to any vnlawfull and inordinate luſt.</p>
            <p>So then in this Commandement we haue diligently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider foure degrees of ſin to be forbidden, which go before that conſent, which is giuen to wicked coueting or luſting.</p>
            <p>I would haue you make rehearſall what they be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are theſe which follovv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, the naturall inclination of the heart, vvhich, ſince the fall of Adam hath bene and is in vs and in all his poſteritie, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt from the vvombe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the thought and imagination, vvhich ariſeth from that ſecret and inmoſt corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the motion vvhich ſpringeth from the thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, conſultation and deliberation, vvhich ariſeth from the motion and delight, is the next forerunner to full conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus to the ſame effect: In this Commuandement the Lord forbiddeth firſt the contraries to originall inclination to that perfect righteouſneſſe and loue, which we do owe to our neighbour: that is to ſay, originall inclination to iniuſtice, and to the hatred of our neighbour. Yea and alſo originall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the inordinate and exceſſiue loue of our ſelues. Euen all the corruption which is come vpon our nature by the fall of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lord forbiddeth the immediate fruites of the ſame inclination to iniuſtice and vnrighteouſneſſe, and to the vile hatred of our neighbour, and to the inordinate loue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:182:141"/> of our ſelues;<note place="margin">Sins forbidden.</note> that is to ſay, all vniuſt and hatefull thoughts and motions of the heart, enticing and prouoking to the hurt of our neighbour, as alſo vaine and fond thoughts, motions &amp; diſcourſes, tending to the puffing vp of our ſelues in ſelfe-loue, pride, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yea further let it be obſerued, that the former inclination, thought, motion, and deliberation, euen concerning lawfull things, and ſuch as do belong to our ſelues, if they ariſe in our hearts before the iuſt time and ſeaſon thereof, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder this coueting which is here forbidden of God.</p>
            <p>As for example, the thought and deſire of mariage before the time meete fot it; alſo longing after the poſſeſsion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance while a mans father is liuing, or being vnder ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, before he is come to lawfull and conuenient age, to enter vpon the poſſeſsion and vſe of it. Yea the flitting deſire or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging after any thing whatſoeuer, before the time and ſeaſon appointed of God, or by no lawfull and good meanes, though the time and ſeaſon may be thought meete and conuenient: all ſuch flitting deſires are here condemned.</p>
            <p>Finally, the not reſiſting of theſe thoughts, motions, and diſcourſes, is againſt the righteouſneſſe of this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being the hinderance of loue, and euerie other good fruite thereof; and the cheriſher of all ſinne againſt our owne conſciences in the fruites of ſelfe-loue and vnkindneſſe againſt our neighbour.</p>
            <p>And thus we haue the vnfolding of the ſinne forbidden in this Commaundemeut: whereby the difference betwixt it and all the former Commaundements of this ſecond Table, may plainely be diſcerned: whereby alſo we both vnderſtand the excellencie of the diuine wiſedome of God, in giuing ſo perfect a Law of all righteouſneſſe and loue toward our neighbour; and likewiſe, we may ſee more deepely into that miſerie or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinke of iniquitie, that lurketh in our corrupt nature, till we be renewed in the ſpirit of our mind, and made new creatures faſhioned againe by the Spirit of God, in a more ſecret manner then we were in our mothers wombe.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, hauing helpe againſt the difficultie &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:182:141"/> of the vnderſtanding of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,<note place="margin">Knowledge of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement moſt neceſſary.</note> I wold glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare the reaſons of you, why the knowledge of it ſhould be ſo ſpecially neceſſary and profitable, as you haue bene taught the ſame to be.</p>
            <p>Which are they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe without the knowledge hereof, we can neither ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the full greatneſſe of our owne ſinne, and the extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which is due to the ſame: nor into the perfect excellency of Gods righteouſneſſe, in the puniſhing of ſinne, nor into the riches of his mercies in forgiuing ſinne and ſauing of ſinners, nor the neceſſity we haue of a Sauiour, neither what godly ſorrow for ſinne meaneth, nor what regeneration and repentance is, nor what it is to be truly humbled before God, nor how great cauſe we haue to be in continuall watch and ward, yea, in earneſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and fight againſt ſinne, leaſt it ſhould get ſtrength to raigne in vs, to the euerlaſting deſtruction both of our bodies and alſo of our ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is euident from the former diſcourſe already layd open in the example of Saint Paule, Rom. 7. and by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which he maketh vpon that diſcourſe, verſes 24.25. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the body of this death? I thanke God through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore we may perceiue, that we do altogether deceiue our ſelues, when we do not iudge our ſelues ſinners but from the euiction of outward diſobedience to Gods Law, and alſo when we thinke well of our ſelues, and that we are in good eſtate, becauſe in our owne conceipt we are better then other. Our actuall ſinnes ſhould be as bloud-hounds vnto vs, by them to trace out our originall corruption after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the prophet Dauid in the 51. Pſalme.</p>
            <p>For let vs looke into the euill luſt and concupiſcence of our hearts, and we ſhall find a workhouſe, yea, a world of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, the which ſhall giue vs iuſt occaſion to condemne our ſelues in the ſight of God, euen when other men can ſee nothing wherefore they ſhould greatly blame vs; euen then (I ſay) ſhall we find plentifull occaſion to cry out with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Miſerable men that we are.</p>
            <p>Godly ſorrow muſt begin from the inward ground of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:182:142"/> heart,<note place="margin">The ſinne of coueting exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified.</note> and for the moſt ſecret euill luſts and motions thereof, or elſe it is no true godly ſorrow.</p>
            <p>As for example, he that hath fallen into fornication, muſt not onely be ſorie for the fact, but chiefly to thinke that he ſhould haue an adulterous and filthy heart. The angry man is not truly ſory for his wrathfull ſpeeches and furious dealing, vnleſſe he be ſory that he is of an angry and teſty or chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike nature. The drunken man is not truly ſory for his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnleſſe he be ſory that he is intemperate in deſire after drinke, &amp;c. Neither he that hath dealt contentiouſly againſt his neighbour, vnleſſe he be ſory that he hath a proud heart.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be ſayd of euery other ſinne. True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt begin the change of the hart, by the change of the thoughts and motions thereof, or elſe it is not true repentance, Ier. chap. 4.14. O Ieruſalem waſh thine hart from wickedneſſe, that thou maieſt be ſaued: how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſhall thy wicked thoughts remaine within thee? To ſpeake in a word, God beginneth his worke of the reformation of man, where Sathan from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning began to deforme man. True reſiſtance of ſin muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the firſt thought and motion, yea, euen at our inclination vnto ſin. Whoſoeuer do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider this, &amp; ſubmit themſelues to this worke of Gods grace, and ſeeke after the increaſe of it, &amp;c. they be no better then hypocrites, they be no true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts and faithfull ſeruants of God, whatſoeuer faire ſhew and appearance they may haue.</p>
            <p>Thus then we may perceiue what it is to couet.</p>
            <p>It followeth that we do conſider which be the things of our neighbour, which God forbiddeth vs to couet: whereof, ſome are expreſly mentioned, the reſt are all vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>Which are thoſe which are expreſly mentioned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt his dwelling houſe, and in the</hi> 5. <hi>chap. of Deut. ver.</hi> 21. <hi>his field is alſo mentioned; then the partes of his houſhold or family, as firſt &amp; principally his wife, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath giuen for his ſpeciall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; then his good &amp; profitable ſeruants, both man-ſeruant &amp; maid, for his inward &amp; home buſines. And laſt of all, his cattel, both oxe &amp; aſſe, for his more outward works, the one for draught and plowing, the other for the vſe of iorneying and other burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe indeed are the things of our neighbor, which the Lord
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:182:142"/> our God expreſly forbiddeth vs to couet, or to haue the leaſt deſire after them, to the diminiſhing either of his more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lawfull pleaſure and comfort, or of his iuſt profit and outward wel-fare.</p>
            <p>A mans wife we know is or ought to be as his chiefe dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and treaſure, and therefore is compared to the louing hind and pleaſant Roe. Reade Prou. 5.19. Yea preferred to all iewels, Prou. 31.10. and therefore is called the delight of her husbands eyes, as the Lord ſpeaketh to Ezekiel concerning his wife, chap. 24.16.18.</p>
            <p>A good and faithfull ſeruant alſo, is of all iuſtly accounted a great bleſſing of God, and there is no man which doth not thinke himſelfe greatly iniured, if at any time ſuch a one be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neighbourly egged and enticed away from him. Conſider further of this point, from Paules Epiſtle to Philemon.</p>
            <p>Finally, touching the profit that commeth by the oxe; the holy Prouerbe ſpeaketh of it, chap. 14.4. Where no oxen are, there the crib is empty: but much increaſe commeth by the ſtrength of the oxe.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore how graciouſly the Lord tendreth euery mans comfort and wel-fare, that he forbiddeth not onely the taking away of theſe things, as King Dauid did Vriahs wife, and as the Shabeans tooke away Iobs oxen and aſſes, and ſlue his ſeruants that kept them, chap. 1. of that booke of Iob. verſes 14.15. but he forbiddeth euen the leaſt coueting and deſiring, or lingering after theſe things, which as hath bene ſhewed is the originall of the outward action.</p>
            <p>Now in that the Lord forbiddeth the coueting after any neighbours wife, which is firſt mentioned in the 5. of Deut. (whether the coueting be becauſe of her beauty or good houſwifry, or wiſdome in gouernment, yea, or though it ſhould be for her godlineſſe) he doth vnder this inſtance forbid both that which we call a voluptuous, fleſhly and carnall mind; and alſo a light vaine and fooliſh mind. And in that he forbiddeth vs to couet our neighbors houſe, field, man-ſeruant or maide, oxe or aſſe, which are all ſet downe in the ſecond place, as we reade in Deuteronomie, the Lord doth by the prohibition of theſe, forbid that ſinne which we call worldlineſſe of mind.</p>
            <pb n="274" facs="tcp:182:143"/>
            <p>To conclude all in few words therefore: It is as much as if the Lord ſhould ſay: Thou ſhalt neither for thy pleaſure ſake, nor for thy profit, deſire any thing that is thy neighbours.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the things expreſly mentioned.</p>
            <p>But the Lord giueth plainly to vnderſtand, that he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to couet any other thing beſide.</p>
            <p>What things may they be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As we are forbidden to couet our neighbours houſe and lands, ſo we are forbidden to couet any of his mouable goods, gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, iewels or plate, corne, vvine, oyle, or any other thing in like ſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As we muſt not couet our neighbours man-ſeruant or maide, ſo neither may we couet his ſonne or his daughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it is not lawfull for vs to deſire his oxe or his aſſe, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may vve wiſh to haue his horſe or his ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, vve muſt needs vnderſtand, that in ſo much as the Lord forbiddeth vs to couet the leſſer, much more doth he forbid all coueting after the greater: As for example, ſeeing we muſt not couet his outward goods to his vvorldly decay, we muſt much leſſe deſire his place of vvorldly honour, as to be ſome Lord, Duke, &amp;c. And leaſt of all, may vve couet his ſpirituall gifts and graces, or the meanes thereof, to the hinderance of his ſaluation. Seeing vve muſt not couet any mans priuate ſeruant, much leſſe muſt vve for our priuate benefit, or affectation and liking, couet to haue any peoples publike good and faithfull Miniſter of Gods vvord from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be denied, that there may fall out iuſt occaſion when a Miniſter of Gods word may be tranſlated as it were, and remoued from one people to another. But that muſt be in an orderly courſe, when it may be diſcerned to be more to the glory of God, &amp;c. and not to ſerue the priuate humour of this or that man, which will ſay, ſuch a one ſhall go for my money, and ſo contemne all other, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt of the things in this anſwer, are ſo plaine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they need no further ſpeech or allegation for the proofe of them. In a word, the coueting of any thing of our neighbors (whatſoeuer is couetable, if we may ſo ſpeake) or in any reſpect deſireable, all is forbidden in this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement.</p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:182:143"/>
            <p>For ſo the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh in his holy language, both in this Commamndement and in many other places, where he vſeth a word from the which all things of deſire, or which be as we ſay in requeſt among men take their name, as Gen. 3.6. where Eue iudging the forbidden tree to be a tree to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, gaue place to her deſire or coueting eye, and ſo brought euill luſt into the world. So Ioſh. 7.21. in the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which Achan maketh: I ſaw among the ſpoile (ſaith he) a goodly Babiloniſh garment, &amp;c. and I coueted them, and tooke them. And euery where in the holy Scriptures, things not to be coueted or deſired from our neighbour, they are called from this word of deſire, as veſſels of deſire for precious veſſels, Dan. 11. verſe 8.38.44. And Prou. 21.20. In the houſe of the wiſe is pleaſant treaſure, or as the word is, a treaſure of deſire, that is, which men count worthy to be deſired. And Iſa. 32.12. f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>elds of deſire for pleaſant fields. And Amos 5.11. vines of deſire for pleaſant vines.</p>
            <p>And generally, all precious and pleaſant things are called ſuch things as be deſirable, Lament. 1.10. The enemy hath ſtretched out his hand vpon all her deſirable things, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now from this repetition of things, both mentioned and alſo more generally to be vnderſtood, which God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to couet, let vs obſerue that the reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the corruption of our nature is ſo plentifull in this euill of coueting, that our neighbour cannot haue that thing of the bountifull hand of God, which our hearts cannot affoord an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill luſt after it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Furthermore alſo we may from hence well perceiue, that it is not lawfull for vs to wiſh any of the ſame things to any friend to the hurt of our neighbour, which we may not wiſh to our ſelues: for this were to preferre our affection to our friend, before the good-will and pleaſure, and moſt wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, who hath otherwiſe appointed and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof.</p>
            <p>Moreouer ſeeing we may wiſh no good thing from our neighbour, either directly to our ſelues, or indirectly to any of our ſpeciall friends, let vs note well, that we may much leſſe, and ſo not without greater ſinne, wiſh our neighbour any
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:182:144"/> dammage or hurt,<note place="margin">Duties, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the grounds of all good dutie commanded.</note> either in body or ſoule, goods or name, wife or child, ſeruant or cattell, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Neither let vs forget here, that the ſame coueting which is forbidden to euery man concerning his neighbours wife: the ſame I ſay, is forbidden to euery woman concerning her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours husband, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, that we may briefly comprehend all which we may not couet, let vs conſider the admonition and charge of the Apoſtle Iohn, concerning the things which we muſt not loue to the hinderance of loue, either toward God or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: as we reade in the 1. Epiſtle of Iohn chap 2. verſes 15.16.17. where he deuideth luſt into three branches as it were; The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life.</p>
            <p>So that accordingly, doth the Lord forbid all couetouſneſſe of the mind after riches; all voluptuouſneſſe of mind, in deſire after pleaſures, and all ambitious deſire of honour.</p>
            <p>Thus much therefore concerning the euils forbidden in this Commandement.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to ſee on the affirmatiue part, what good things God commandeth in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Shew which they be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, God ſtaightly requireth, that euery of vs do diſpoſe of our minds, to ſtand fully ſatisfied and contented vvith that portion of bleſſing, both ſpirituall and belonging to this life, vvhich he of his diuine vviſedome and grace, alotteth vnto vs from time to time: vvhether it be plenty or vvant, more or leſſe, following our preſent buſineſſe, and vſing all lawfull meanes, vvith a quiet mind, and vvithout any diſtruſtfull care for the morrovv, paitently vvaiting vpon God, vntill it ſhall pleaſe him in his good time, and by his moſt gracious and prouident hand to better our eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that vve haue our hearts and minds, readily and conſtantly inclined and bent, to reioyce at all the mercies vvhich God hath already, or ſhall hereafter beſtow vpon euery of our neighbours, in what meaſure ſoeuer it be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that vve do ſtudiouſly deuiſe hovv vve may do them moſt good, and from the ſecrets of our ſoules deſire and long after their further benefit, as may ſtand vvith the good-vvill
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:182:144"/> and pleaſure of Almighty God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that on the other ſide vve be ready to lament what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer falleth out vnproſperouſly againſt them, and that we be vvilling to our power to procure the remedying of the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the Commandements of the ſecond Table of the Law going before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, that vve do earneſtly and conſtantly ſettle our ſelues to bewaile, reſiſt, and ſuppreſſe all contrary luſts, motions and temptations, which ſhall at any time ariſe in our hearts, vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or more briefly thus: The Lord our God requireth of vs in this his laſt Commandement: firſt, originall righteouſneſſe and perfect loue toward our neighbour, as the ground of all good duties toward them, according to our firſt creation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he commandeth vs the immediate fruites of the ſame originall righteouſneſſe, and perfect loue of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in all righteous and louing thoughts and motions of the heart, tending to the greateſt good which we may procure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ioyned alſo with the deniall of our ſelues, and all that ſelfe-loue and pride which through the corruption of nature aboundeth in vs.</p>
            <p>But concerning the parts of the anſwer ſomewhat more at large. For the firſt point, let vs conſider that this laſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is (as one may not vnfitly compare it) the Sabbath of the ſecond Table of the Law; ſeeing it requireth ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ceaſſing of all hatred, yea, of all vnkindneſſe againſt our neighbour, that we may from the perfect ground of loue and tender regard of him, onely intend to do him the greateſt good which poſſibly we may. Conſider of this further, from the doctrine of contentment, 1. Timothie 6.6. and Hebrews chapter 13.5. and from the doctrine of the right manner of vſing this world and the things thereof, both profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, 1. Corint. 7. verſes 29.30.31.32. And likewiſe from the example of the Apoſtle, in an excellent meaſure, through the grace of God, though not in full perfection, Phil. 4.11.12.13. I haue learned (ſaith the holy Apoſtle) in what eſtate ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I am, to be therewithall content. I can be abaſed, and I can abound, and to be full and to hungry, to abound and to haue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:182:145"/> want. I am able to do all things through the helpe of Chriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, reade 1. Theſ. 5.7.8.9. and 1. Pet. 1.22.</p>
            <p>For the third point, conſider the nature of true loue, that it is farre from minding euill againſt a mans neighbor, (as 1. Cor. 13.5. Loue thinketh not euill) that it deuiſeth how to do good, Iſaiah 32.7.8. The liberall man will deuiſe of liberall things. The contrary is ſeuerely reproued, 1. Iohn. 3.17.18. and Iames 2.8.9.14. &amp;c. Reade the places.</p>
            <p>For the fourth point, reade Rom. 13.15.16. Reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe. Be of like affection one to another.</p>
            <p>Naturally euery man aſpireth to be his owne, as entir and whole in himſelfe as may be, that he may ſtand in need of none, nor be combered with the care of any, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the naturall ſtudy and corrupt deſire of vs all. But the Apoſtle Paule guided by the holy Spirit of God, teacheth vs all, both by doctrine and by example another manner of leſſon: he counting himſelfe a detter to all men, both Iew and Gentile, Rom. 1.14. So ought we likewiſe to account our ſelues, according to our gift, place, and calling. Conſider alſo the example of the ſame Apoſtle in his excellent meaſure, 1. Cor. 10.33. and 1. Cor. 7.13. &amp;c. chap. 11.28 29. &amp; 1. Theſ. 2.8. Conſider alſo the example of Nehemiah chap. 1. verſes 1.2.3.4. &amp;c. and chap. 2.3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the laſt point, conſider the example of the Apoſtle Paule, Rom. 7.24. O wretched man that I am. Reade alſo Acts 8.22.</p>
            <p>Hitherto what is forbidden, and contrariwiſe what the Lord God commandeth in this his tenth Comandement.</p>
            <p>The equity is next to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>How may that be diſcerned of vs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The equity of this Commaundement may be diſcerned two vvayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, in reſpect of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, in reſpect of our ſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew therefore in the firſt place how it may be diſcerned in reſpect of God?</p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:182:145"/>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſo much as the Lord our God is the ſoueraigne iudge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Equitie.</note> 
               <hi>not onely of mens actions and determinate purpoſes, but alſo of their vnſetled thoughts and motions: yea, ſeeing he is the Creator of mans perſon and nature it ſelfe (vvhich alſo he made very good and perfectly vvell diſpoſed in the beginning of the creation) it is very equall and meete, that he ſhould both forbid and alſo condemne the moſt ſecret corruption of nature, vvith all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fruites thereof, as vvell as the outward actions, ſeeing the one as well as the other do proceed from the Diuell, through mans owne default: and alſo that he ſhould on the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and command all that originall righteouſneſſe and perfect diſpoſition of nature, and of all the powers thereof, which he had at the firſt moſt graciouſly giuen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt needs be acknowledged moſt iuſt and equall indeed. For what reaſon can there be, that the righteouſneſſe of God ſhould giue place to the luſtes of the Diuell, and to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt will of man: ſuch as are all the luſtes and motions of ſinne, according to the reproofe of our Sauiour Chriſt, Iohn. 8.44. Ye are of your father the Diuell, and the luſtes of your father ye will do.</p>
            <p>The Law alſo muſt be agreeable to the nature of the giuer. He therefore being moſt ſpirituall yea ſpirit it ſelfe, muſt needs in all equity giue a moſt ſpirituall Law, binding the moſt ſecret motions and powers of the ſoules and ſpirits of all his ſubiects. His Law in all equity, muſt in this reſpect exceed all humane Lawes, of the moſt wiſe and iuſt Law-giuers whoſoeuer. For they can take no further knowledge of difobedience, but from the diſloyall actions or ſpeeches of their ſubiects: otherwiſe they haue no ground to proceed againſt them for the ſecret intents and motions of their minds, how dangerous and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ſoeuer they be.</p>
            <p>Neither indeed is any creature in his owne right Lord ouer the ſoules and ſpirits of men. This ſoueraignty belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God.</p>
            <p>Shew therefore in the next place, how the equity of this Commandement may be diſcerned in reſpect of our ſelues?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we ſhould not begin our obedience to God from our inward thoughts &amp; motions: yea, euen from a renewed inclination of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:182:146"/> very ſpirit of our mind, we could not poſſibly performe either any true obedience vnto him, or any true loue or duty toward our neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: it ſhould be only an hypocriticall and phariſaicall obedience and a diſſembling loue, which he can take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in. God loueth truth in the inward parts, Pſal. 51. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the heart eſpecially, Prou. 4.23. Neither can he abide that it ſhould be withheld from him, Matth. 15.7.8.9.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo Rom. 12.9. Let loue be without diſſimulation. And 1. Peter. 1.22. We muſt loue brotherly without faining, and with a pure heart feruently.</p>
            <p>It is a ſingular benefit to haue a moſt ſubtile and dangerous enemy diſcouered vnto one. Such an enemy is this wicked luſt, Epheſ. 4.22. 1. Pet. 2.11. Iames 4.1. 2. Tim. 2.22.</p>
            <p>And beſide the moſt proſperous fight and incounter againſt ſinne, is in the firſt thought and motion of it: for otherwiſe it gathereth ſtrength, and is according to the proceedings of it, ſo much the more hardly vanquiſhed afterward.</p>
            <p>The ſpeciall equity of this Commaundement iuſtifieth the ſpeciall curſes of God threatned againſt the tranſgreſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe curſes are now to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Shew what you haue bene taught concerning this point?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like as the tranſgreſſion of this Commandement is the roote and cheriſher of all ſinne, and the extinguiſher, or rather as the barre of a ſtrong fortreſſe, vtterly to let and hinder all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and loue toward our neighbour, and therewithall likewiſe all loue and good dutie to God, (for as the Apoſtle Iohn ſaith in the firſt Epiſtle chapter</hi> 4.20. <hi>Hovv can he that loueth not his brother vvhom he hath ſeene, loue God vvhom he hath not ſeene) ſo it openeth a paſſage for the curſes of God againſt all the ſinnes forbidden in the vvhole Lavv, to enter in and to ouerflow all, like to the increaſe and gathering together of many vvaters, till they grovv to a mighty and raging floud: ſuch a one vvhereof vve reade in the holy Prouerbe, that it leaueth no fooode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A good reaſon, anſwerable to the nature of this ſinne: the which as it groweth in offence, ſo it procureth the increaſe of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:182:146"/> the puniſhment againſt it ſelfe:<note place="margin">The Curſes.</note> according to that gradation which the Apoſtle Iames vſeth, chapter. 1.15. When luſt hath conceiued it bringeth forth ſinne, and ſinne when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</p>
            <p>And that this ſinne is the mother-ſinne and breed of all the reſt, reade Rom. 7.5. The motions of ſinnes which are by the Law (to wit through the corruption of the fleſh) they find force in our members, to bring foorth fruite vnto death. In which reſpect alſo it is ſaid, that the old Teſtament, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh allegorically) is Agar of Mount Sinai, which gendreth vnto bondage, Gal. 4.24.</p>
            <p>That the ſame ſinne alſo quencheth, yea, without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, vtterly hindereth all goodneſſe and vertue, reade Gal. 5.17. The fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot do the ſame things that ye would. Reade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the places alledged after the former anſwere, 2. Tim. 2.22. Iames 4.1. and 1. Pet. 2.11. Wherefore not without cauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this ſinne eſpecially, doth the Apoſtle cry out, bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe as being in the eſtate of a miſerable man ſubiect to death, yea, to eternall death without Chriſt, as we haue ſeene before.</p>
            <p>This euill of coueting is of it ſelfe a miſerable puniſhment: for it maketh vs more reſtleſſe and vnquiet in euery want and trouble, then are the brute beaſts.</p>
            <p>It blindeth our eyes, ſo that hauing many bleſſings, it is with vs as though we enioyed none at all. Yea it turneth bleſſing it ſelfe to be a curſe vnto vs, by reaſon of our vnthankefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of this ſecret euill, it commeth alſo to paſſe, that there be many great iudgements of God in the world, and thoſe alſo vpon diuerſe particular perſons, whereof we can ſee no reaſon.</p>
            <p>For a man may be in outward ſhew, of commendable cariage among men, and yet before God who ſeeth the heart and trieth the reines, the ſame perſon may iuſtly be odious before God, becauſe of his hypocriſie and diſſimulation, or deſire of vaine-glorie and praiſe, &amp;c. Yea, a man may thinke himſelfe worthy to be preferred before many of his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:182:147"/> neighbours, and yet be reiected of God becauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull heart. So we reade Prou. 16.2. Ier. 17.9. and Luke 16.15. Reade alſo Prou. 15.26. and Zach. 8.17. compared with Prou. 28.6. Better is the poore that walketh in his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, then he that peruerteth his wayes though he be rich.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore we may generally ſee the tranſgreſſion of this Commandement to be highly diſpleaſing in the ſight of God, and that it is the originall ſping as it were of infinite cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: yea, that it is a grieuous curſe, and a very bitter puniſhment in it ſelfe, if we could rightly diſcerne of it.</p>
            <p>But ſhew if you can ſomething more particularly, what is the proper curſe of God againſt the tranſgreſſion of it. And ſhew it alſo by ſome more particular and expreſſe teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas it is a very heauy curſe and plague of God, for any to be giuen ouer to ſinne, and ſo to haue one ſinne puniſhed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; as our Sauiour Chriſt giueth vs to vnderſtand, in that he teacheth vs to pray, Leade vs not into temptation: this moſt heauy curſe and puniſhment doth eſpecially belong to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of this Commaundement, vpon all thoſe that make no conſcience to reſiſt the firſt thoughts and motions of ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true: they which reſiſt them not, muſt needs be led captiues, ſeeing they that ſtriue earneſtly cannot without ſome difficulty, nor altogether without ſome foile preuaile and ouercome.</p>
            <p>But I ſpeake as touching inward foile and captiuity of thoughts at vnwares for a time, according to that of the holy Apoſtle, Rom. 7.23. and 2. Cor. 12.7.8.9.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe as in the ſame places it appeareth: God in mercy, both pardoneth and aſſiſteth the weakeneſſe of thoſe that do vnfainedly reſiſt. Onely he accurſeth and puniſheth them that diſſolutely giue place to their luſt, and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be miſ-led by it.</p>
            <p>What proofe haue you of this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 106. <hi>Pſalme. verſes</hi> 14.15.16. <hi>it is vvritten of the Iſraelites, that they luſted vvith concupiſcence in the vvilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tempted God in the deſert. Then he gaue them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but he ſent leanneſſe into their ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:182:147"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the beginning of the</hi> 2. <hi>chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Micah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bleſſings.</note> 
               <hi>Woe to them (ſaith the holy Prophet) that imagine iniquity, and worke wickedneſſe vpon their beds: when the morning is light, they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, becauſe their hand hath power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And they couet fields, and take them by violence, and houſes and take them away: ſo they oppreſſe a man and his houſe, euen man and his heritage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Behold againſt this family haue I deuiſed a plague, whereout ye ſhall not plucke your neckes, and ye ſhall not go ſo proudly: for this time is euill.

            </p>
            <p>Reade alſo Habbak 29.10.11. And the heauy imprecation of the Apoſtle Peter againſt Simon the ſorcerer of Samaria. He ſheweth there, that ſome great iudgement did hang ouer his head, for that he gaue place to his wicked thought, imagining that the gift of God might be obtained with mony, Acts chap. 8. verſes 18.19.20.21.22.23.24.</p>
            <p>And generally concerning the euill thoughts of the wicked, we reade Pſal. 94.11. The thoughts of man are vanity, &amp; Pſal. 146.4. The thoughts of the wicked ſhall periſh.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the curſe againſt the tranſgreſſion. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of obedience to it commeth now to be examined.</p>
            <p>What is the bleſſing which God hath promiſed to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If in ſtead of wiſhing and coueting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our neighbors any thing which is theirs, we would inure and acquaint our harts to bleſſe God for that portion of his good bleſſings which we do enioy our ſelues; and for euery good and comfortable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity wherewith God of his mercy hath bleſſed them: it ſhould ſurely come to paſſe, that (beſide ſingular inward peace which wold from thence ariſe to our conſcience) we ſhould find the like open bleſſing from the hand of God, which God hath promiſed to ſecret prayer, that is to ſay, he would reward vs openly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, no doubt he would bleſſe vs both openly and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with outward bleſſings &amp; ſpirituall bleſſings, with the good things both of this life and alſo of the life to come. For God
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:182:148"/> who hath promiſed all things to godlineſſe, 1. Tim. 4.8. will not deny any thing to that good and holy diſpoſition of the mind, which by the worke of his grace is as the ground of godlineſſe in vs, and from the which true godlineſſe cannot be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>As euill thoughts &amp; motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s make way for al curſes to enter in, as was anſwered before: ſo doth inward ſincerity, vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and purity of heart, holy thoughts, meditations, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, deſires, and purpoſes; they through the mercies of God do open the windowes of heauen (as it were a key) to cauſe all bleſſings to deſcend downe vpon the heads of all the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God: according to that we reade Prou. 10.6. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are vpon the head of the righteous. And there are many places of the holy Scriptures, the teſtimonies whereof tend to this purpoſe, as you haue bene further inſtructed.</p>
            <p>I would haue you make rehearſall of ſome of thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for the confirmation of this point.</p>
            <p>Which may thoſe teſtimonies be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that loueth pureneſſe of heart (ſaith king Salomon) for the grace of his lips the king ſhall be his friend, Prou.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Yea, the king of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal bleſſe him, as it followeth in the next verſe.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And our Sauiour Chriſt Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, Prouerbs</hi> 14.22. <hi>To them that thinke on good things,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:182:148"/> ſhall be mercy and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And chap.</hi> 22.5. <hi>The thoughts of the diligent do ſurely bring abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe places of holy Scripture and the like, do indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that God hath promiſed all kind of bleſſing to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of this Commaundement. For although pureneſſe of heart, vprightneſſe, inward delight, meditation, and good thoughts laſt mentioned, do belong to the duties of all the Commaundements: yet they haue as it were their manſion place &amp; reſidence in this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after a ſpeciall maner.</p>
            <p>And let vs marke I pray you, how God honoureth vpright, pure, and holy thoughts, with the bleſſing of the actions and duties themſelues: becauſe from thence, as from the originall all the actions of life do proceed, according to that Prou. 4.23. which ſentence was alledged not long before. So on the contrary, the holy Apoſtle Saint Paule chargeth his wicked nature with action of ſinne, by reaſon of the euill thoughts and motions thereof, though he laboured againſt them, and gaue them no harty conſent, Rom. 7.19. I do not the good (ſaith he) which I would, but the euill which I would not, that do I.</p>
            <p>And yet againe on the other ſide, Phil. 4.8.9. Thinke on theſe things (ſaith he) that is, thinke of them earneſtly, and with a care to practiſe them.</p>
            <p>And the God of peace ſhall be with you, yea, to giue that peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, whereof he had written before in the 7. verſe of the ſame chapter.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee how great a part of our bleſſing, yea, how the ground of mans whole bleſſing in a manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the obedience of this Commaundement, if happily we could be free from the euill coueting forbidden in it; and if we had ſuch pure, vpright, and godly hearts as we ought to haue, both in loue to God and to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>But that we may now at the laſt come to the vſe of this Commandement, according as we haue ſeene the vſe of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Haue you perfectly obeyed this Commandement, which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:182:149"/> is as the ſealing vp of all perfect obedience,<note place="margin">Euerie one of vs is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</note> that thereby you may eſcape the curſe, and be partaker of the bleſſing of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perfect obedience of it, that I do more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſin againſt it, then againſt any other Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Table, according as my vaine &amp; flitting thoughts &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more then either my ſetled conſent or performed actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, my diſobedience againſt this laſt Commandement, is the cauſe why I do diſobey all the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, when as the other Comandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhew me to be a ſinner in the words, actions, and purpoſes of my life; this conuinceth me to be out of meaſure ſinfull, euen in my very nature and perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things which you haue anſwered, are not onely true concerning your ſelfe, and euery one of vs, and all the children of men, while yet we lye altogether in our naturall ignorance and vanity, &amp; in the luſt of the fleſh and of the mind: but they are alſo true concerning all that be regenerate by the Spirit of God, though in them the ſecret luſts of the fleſh do not preuaile and get dominion ouer them, as they do ouer the children of this world.</p>
            <p>Touching the vngenerate, we need not ſtand to vſe much proofe. It is euident, Gen. 6.5. Ier. 17.9. &amp; chap. 18.18. Pſa. 36.3.4. Prou. 4.16. &amp; chap. 16.30. and Rom. 8.7 In the beſt things they do, they are inwardly altogether corrupt, &amp; therefore the Lord reiecteth all their hearing of his word, their prayers and their ſacrifices, Iſa. 58.2. &amp;c. Ezek. 33.31. Prou. 15.18. &amp; cha 21.27. and chap. 28.9. Iſa. chap. 1.</p>
            <p>That the ſame naturall corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaineth ſtill inherent in the regenerate, though not in the ſame meaſure, reade Gal. 5.17. and 2. Cor. 3.5 Heb. 12.1. But moſt plentifully this matter i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what need we any other proofes then our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For are not our thoughts very vaine and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and our affections alwayes inclining to vnlawfull luſting and coueting?

            <p>Behold therefore the moſt excellent vſe of this laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, in the diſcouering or drawing out, as it were by the eares, this our moſt ſecret and daungerous ſinne: the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience whereof is more infinit then againſt any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of this ſecond Table, as was anſwered.

            <p>It is to ſingular purpoſe therefore, that we be ſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that our Sauiour Chriſt hath fulfilled it for vs:</p>

               <hi>It is hence moſt ſurely to be proued, in that albeit he was the naturall ſeed of man: yet he was not immediatly begotten by the corrupt and ſinfull generation of man, but by the most gracious vertue and diuine power of the holy Ghoſt, who moſt perfectly ſanctified the ſame his humane nature, euen from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his conception, and thenceforth alſo inſeparably vnited it to the diuine nature, ſo to continue for euer in one moſt holy and diuine perſon, of a perfect Mediator and Sauiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a moſt ſure and vndoubted proofe indeed. For as that which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh: that is to ſay, corrupt
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:182:150"/> and ſinfull, (for how ſhould he be cleane that is borne of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Iob chap. 15.14. to wit in the vſuall courſe of mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation) ſo that which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit: that is, he is ſpirituall, one waſhed, cleanſed, and ſanctified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, Iohn. chap. 3.6. But in moſt ſingular manner was our Sauiour Chriſt ſpirituall, as is euident in that he was moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably and extraordinarily conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, and borne of a virgine, to the end he might be moſt perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and true, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And beſide, ſeeing there is no fellowſhip betwixt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe, 2. Corinth. 6.14. how could the diuine nature be ioyned ſo nearely and vnſeparably with the humane nature of Chriſt in one perſon for euer, vnleſſe it had bene free from all ſinne; yea, vnleſſe it had bene moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſanctified? He is alſo called vndefiled, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We may boldly conclude therefore, that our Sauiour Chriſt was moſt pure and holy, both in nature and will, euen from his very birth and conception; though all other both men and women are naturally conceiued and borne in ſinne.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing ſome peraduenture will obiect, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our Sauiour Chriſt was thus perfect by conception and birth, as Adam was at the beginning by creation; yet as Adam was tempted, and by temptation fell; ſo in ſo much as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt was alſo tempted by the Diuell, and that not only in thoſe fortie dayes together, whereof we reade, Matth. chap. 4. but at ſundrie times all the dayes of his life, euen ſo often as the Diuell might thinke himſelfe to haue any aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, (for the Diuell left our Sauiour Chriſt at the end of the fortie dayes temptation, but for a ſeaſon, as we reade, Luke 14.15.) it may be therefore (as we began to ſay) that ſome will obiect, that it may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our Sauiour Chriſt alſo did one time or other fall away by temptation. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to confirme our ſelues to beleeue, that howſoeuer Adam a glorious creature was ſoone ſeduced and peruerted; yet our Sauiour Chriſt was neuer by any temptation corrupted, or one haire breadth turned out of the way.</p>
            <p>What proofe can you alledge for this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſo much as we haue expreſſe testimonie in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:182:150"/> that our Sauiour Christ vanquiſhed the Diuell in the moſt mightie and daungerous aſſaults that euer he made; we haue no reaſon to doubt of his victorie at all times elſe: according to that which our Sauiour himſelfe aſſureth vnto vs, Iohn chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>ſaying, The Prince of this world commeth, and hath nought in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is doubtleſſe a very ſound and ſure confirmation. Now therefore, touching the Diuels principall temptations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he laboured mightily with all his craft and ſubtiltie he could to haue found ſomething in our Sauiour Chriſt, whereby he might haue taken aduantage and preuailed againſt him, and ſo to haue hindred both his &amp; our ſaluation: we know they were either that temptation of fortie dayes, in his entrance vpon the open execution of his office of mediatorſhip; or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſet vpon him a litle before his death, and at his death vpon the croſſe, which he yeeldeth himſelfe vnto for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And well may all the temptations of the Diuell be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder theſe. For the Diuell alwaies tempteth either by deceitfull and alluring temptations, or by thoſe that be more violent and terrible, according as he imagineth he may take his beſt aduantage, &amp; according to the vttermoſt of that permiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or commiſsion which the Lord in his wiſedome and iuſtice graunteth vnto him. The former temptations therefore, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Diuell aſſaulted our Sauiour Chriſt, were in moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and deceitfull maner.</p>
            <p>The latter was by terrible impulſion, when he ſaw our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in his moſt bitter agonies, if poſsibly by all his force he could haue wrung out any impatience or murmuring, or blaſphemie and curſed ſpeech, either againſt God, who was for the time in the perſon of an aduerſarrie or angrie and terrible iudge: or againſt men, who were the moſt buſie, and prouoking inſtruments of the Diuell that might be, to haue put him beſide patience, and to haue extorted ſome vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeech and behauiour from him: yea if they could, to haue driuen him to vtter diſpaire of Gods loue and mercie toward him. For this was the drift of the Diuel no doubt, and to this end and purpoſe did he enrage his inſtruments of all ſorts
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:182:151"/> of men, both Iewes and Gentiles, at that time which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt found to be the very houre and power of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Luke chap. 21.53. euen the time wherein the Diuell was let looſe, as it were without limitation to execute his full malice and to do his very worſt: but at neither of theſe times, either former or latter, or laſt of all, could he by the one meanes or by the other, either by flatterie or by force, or by both of them together, preuaile: but in either of theſe principall incounters, and ſpecially at the laſt, when the Diuell was let looſe in his full ſtrength, yea when all the Diuels in hell (as we may ſay) were bent againſt him, our Sauiour Chriſt did moſt gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triumph, according to that moſt comfortable teſtimonie of the holy Apoſtle, Col. 2.15. where he affirmeth, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt by his moſt perfect faith, and loue, and patience, &amp; prayer, and all inuincible vertues, did royally ſpoile principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers, and that he made a ſhew of them openly, and triumphed ouer them on the croſſe. For notwithſtanding all thoſe moſt mightie prouocations to the contrarie, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faithfull to God, and called vpon him as vpon his God in his moſt extreame diſcomfort; and he continued alſo in perfect loue to men, as a moſt mercifull high Prieſt and ſhepheard to his flocke, and prayed for them, yea euen for ſuch of them, as for the preſent were among his chiefe aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we may reſolue our ſelues, that aboue all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or doubt, our Sauiour Chriſt preuailed alwaies againſt all the Diuels temptations, &amp; neuer fell the leaſt iot that might be, from his moſt pure and perfect obedience, no nothing in any the leaſt thought, but abode firmely in his ſtedfaſtneſſe to the end, and remaining for euer a perfect and princely high Prieſt according to the order of Melchiſedech, who was both a King and a Prieſt, as we reade in the holy Scriptures, Pſalme 110. and often repeated in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes. And beſide, we haue often heard from the teſtimonie of many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that he knew no ſinne, &amp; that he is the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Perfect therefore is our redemption by our Prince and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, whereby he hath deliuered vs from all our vaine thoughts and motions, and from the verie originall corruption
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:182:151"/> and ſinfull contagion of our nature, as well as from all our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tranſgreſſions and rebellions againſt euerie Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the moſt holy &amp; righteous Law of the Lord our God: ſeeing he continued in all things that are written in the booke of the Law to do them. To him therefore together with the ſame God who is by Chriſt our heauenly Father, and to the holy Ghoſt, three perſons, one God, moſt wiſe, holy, righteous, &amp; mercifull, be all honor and glorie both now &amp; for euermore.</p>
            <p>But are we ſo diſcharged by our Sauiour Chriſt, that we need not to make any reckening of the originall corruption of our nature, and the immediate fruites thereof; that is, of our vaine thoughts, and looſe and wandring motions and luſtes, ſo farre foorth at the leaſt, as we giue no conſent to be led by them, and to commit the outward actions thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nothing leſſe: for although, through the mercies of God, &amp; becauſe of that reconciliation vvhich our Sauiour Chriſt hath made by his bloud, they ſhall not be imputed vnto vs: vve muſt neuertheleſſe be vvatchfull in ſtriuing againſt them, vve must inſtantly ſigh vp vnto God from the ſecrets of our ſoules, &amp; pray alvvaies for the forgiueneſſe of them, and for his grace to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them: and finally, vve muſt moſt tenderly cheriſh all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie good motions, thoughts and meditations, vvhich God by his holy Spirit &amp; by the miniſterie of his vvord ſhall put into our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true: our hearts ought to be as nimble and readie through the grace of God, to reſiſt all ſecret temptations and luſts, as our nature is rife and lauiſh to cauſe them ſuddenly to ariſe and ſtart vp. We ſhould be as readie alwaies to pray to God againſt them, as they are preſt and readie to ſolicite vs to withdraw our hearts from God. This euill luſt and concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of ours, muſt be watched and fought againſt continually, after the example of the Apoſtle Paule, Rom. 7, euen ſo long as we carie about vs this corrupt nature of ours, as againſt a monſter of manie heads.</p>
            <p>Alwaies euill thoughts and motions will haue the firſt foot in euery matter.</p>
            <p>The Lord in the beginning curſed the Serpent, becauſe it was the Diuels inſtrument, to bring ſinne into the world, when
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:182:152"/> as before there was no euill luſt in mans pure nature.<note place="margin">How we are to repent and obey this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing, euer ſince the entrance of euill luſt, this hath bene, and is the Deuils ſecret meanes to entice and draw vs vnto all ſinne, it ought to be more odious vnto vs then any ſerpent can be. I would heare yet one thing more of you: What thoughts and motions do you meane by vaine thoughts, and wandring luſts and motions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All thoughts, motions and luſts whatſoeuer they are, they are all of them vaine and ſinfull, which be not agreeable to the word and will of God, and which tend not to the right ends; that is, to the glorie of God: &amp; to the benefit of his Church &amp; people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, Whether ye eate or drink, or whatſoeuer ye do, do all to the glorie of God. 1. Cor. 10.31. So we may ſay, whatſoeuer ye thinke, mind, or deuiſe, let it be to the glorie of God.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing by the meanes of the contrarie vanitie and euill coueting which is in vs, our minds are moſt feeble and fickle in themſelues touching all good thoughts and meditations, that we cannot ſtay our hearts in them; we may ſee from hence moſt liuely, how great and vrgent cauſe we haue, alwaies to lift vp our eyes to our Sauiour Chriſt, who was and is ſtill lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp vnto vs, like vnto that healing ſerpent which was lifted vp by Moſes in the wilderneſſe, that by faith in him we may obtaine helpe, euen a ſoueraigne counterpoiſon againſt the ſtingings of this venimous ſerpent, who hath ſo deepely and ſo deadly conueyed his poiſon into vs.</p>
            <p>We may ſee alſo, what great cauſe we haue to be continuall in praier to God, that it wold pleaſe him to ſanctifie our hearts, that the thoughts and meditations thereof may be acceptable vnto him, according to the prayer of Dauid, in the 19. Pſalme.</p>
            <p>VVe may perceiue likewiſe, what great cauſe we haue to acquaint our ſelues with the holy Sacraments, and to make due vſe from theſe ſenſible aſſurances of Gods loue, that thereby we may the rather haue power againſt the vanitie of our minds, &amp;c. Let vs learne to make the Lord our portion. And let Chriſt our Sauiour be in ſteade of al couetable or deſirable things vnto vs: according to the doctrine which we haue heard out of the 16. Pſal. and as we reade Song of ſongs, chap. 5.16.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:182:152"/> that Chriſt is to the Church in ſteade of all ſweet things,<note place="margin">It leades vs backe to the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and thence through all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</note> yea wholly delectable, that is, according to the Hebrew word there vſed, all whatſoeuer is worthie to be coueted or deſired.</p>
            <p>And thus, this 10. Commandement which is as it were the period and full point of the Law of God, &amp; the end as one may ſay, of the race or gole of humane charitie, it directeth vs backe againe to the firſt Commandement, and euen to God himſelf, the onely true fountaine of all loue, and the moſt worthie to be loued of all; and for whoſe ſake alſo, we ſhould according to this Commandement perfectly loue euerie neighbour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we reade, 1. Tim. 1.5. The end of the Commandement is loue out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith vnfained. The Law of God therfore, as alſo the obedience thereof, may be compared to a circular courſe, the end whereof is as one may ſay the beginning of the ſame: or to a golden chaine, the linkes whereof are ſo faſtened together, that no one can be ſundred from the whole, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their mutuall connexion and knitting together: in the which alſo, the laſt is alwaies next to that which ſoeuer a man ſhall recken for the firſt.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſo large a circuit, that no man can euer make his walke out of the compaſſe or command of it.</p>
            <p>Finally, in ſomuch as loue ought both to begin, continue, and end in the Lord, &amp; for his ſake, it is manifeſt that although we are to loue all vnfainedly, yet by how much any among the reſt, do more liuely reſemble the image of God in that true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe which the Law commaundeth, ſo much the more dearely are we to regard and loue them, as the more honourable members of the houſhold of God. The leaſt alſo of ſuch ought to be alwaies more regarded and loued of vs, then the greateſt and moſt glorious of the prophane and vngodly children of this wicked and malignant euill world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the 3. verſe of the 16. Pſalme men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a litle before.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, to God onely wiſe, moſt holy, righteous and mercifull, the moſt worthie of all loue, feare, honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for this his great mercie in giuing vs ſo holy, righteous, and perfect a Law, for the diſcouering and diſcloſing of our ſinne
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:182:153"/> and miſerie, and for the guiding of vs to Chriſt Ieſus the onely mediatour of our eternall happineſſe and ſaluation, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie, and praiſe both now and for euer. Amen.</p>

               <p>Ye may remember, that for the concluſion and ſhutting vp of this part of our Catechiſme, diuerſe proofes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, to ſhew the generall perfection of the whole Law, both for the wiſedome, and alſo the righteouſneſſe of it.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe diuerſe proofes were rehearſed, for the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the whole Law; and for the curſes which God hath generally threatened againſt the tranſgreſſion of it; and for the bleſſing which he hath generally promiſed to the obedience of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, diuerſe proofes haue bene alledged for our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diſobedience, and that therefore of our ſelues, we haue not onely no intereſt in any of the bleſsings, but that all the curſes are due vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe diuerſe proofes for the perfect obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt, by whoſe death and perfect obedience onely, we are deliuered from euerie curſe, and made partakers of all bleſsings.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, from that which followeth in the 20. chapter of Exodus, from the 18. verſe to the 21. we haue ſeene both to what ends and purpoſes, the Lord God did in moſt fearefull maner publiſh his Law vnto his people, and alſo what effects it wrought in the hearts of the people of Iſraell, to whom it was in that fearefull maner publiſhed.</p>
               <p>And ſo from thence, to what ends the Lord will haue the ſame his moſt holy and righteous Law, to be preached from time to time vnto his people: &amp; what vſes we our ſelues (who through the goodnes of God haue now lately heard it ſo fully

               <p>Firſt therefore, what proofe do you remember concerning the generall perfection of the wiſedome and righteouſneſſe of the Law of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One principall proofe was alledged out of the</hi> 4. <hi>chapter of Deut. the</hi> 5.6.7. <hi>and</hi> 8. <hi>verſes, in theſe words: Behold (ſaith Moſes to the people of Iſraell) I haue taught you ordinances &amp; lawes, as the Lord my God commaunded me, that ye ſhould do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo within the land whither ye go to poſſeſſe it.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For what great nation is there, vnto whom the Gods come ſo neare vnto them, as the Lord our God is neare vnto vs in al that we call vnto him for?</hi>

                  <hi>And what great nation is there, that hath ordinances and lawes ſo righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was one principall proofe alledged indeed, which as we ſee, euidently commendeth the excellencie and perfection of the Law of God, with all the appertenances; ſuch as are the holy rites and ceremonies thereof, yea euen from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the heathen themſelues, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>This excellent commendation of the Law of God, is to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular end and purpoſe. For the knowledge of it is a neceſſarie introduction to all obedience, as on the contrarie, the baſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it is the high way to all ſinne. But leauing this point:</p>
               <p>What proofe do you remember to haue bene alledged, to ſhew the generall meaning of God in his Law, both on the negatiue part, and alſo on the affirmatiue part of the ſame?</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt alſo, as hath bene anſwered before, comprehendeth all obedience to the Law, vnder the perfect loue of God, and the perfect loue of our neighbour.</p>

In theſe and ſuch like ſentences are both the curſe and the bleſſing moſt briefly comprehended, that euerie one might eaſily remember them. Reade Ioſhua 22.18.20. and Deut. 27. the laſt verſe. The curſe is briefly noted apart.</p>
               <p>More largely the ſame are laid foorth together, Deut. 11. verſ. 26.27. &amp;c. and chapter 30. from the 8. verſe to the end. Reade alſo Iob chap. 22. verſ. 15.16. &amp;c. to the end. And Pſal. 50. the whole Pſal. and Ier. chap. 7. And Rom. 2.5.6.7. &amp;c. 16.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuch like places of holy Scripture the more large declaration of the curſe and bleſsing is contained.</p>
               <p>But as you may remember, there were ſome other places and proofes to this purpoſe recited, wherein the generall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and bleſsings are moſt largely deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Which places and proofes were they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are the vvhole</hi> 26. <hi>chap. of Leuiticus, and likevviſe the vvhole</hi> 28. <hi>chapter of Deuteronomie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe whole chapters indeed being very large chapters, are repleniſhed with recitall of the manifold bleſsings which God aſſureth to all that will obey his Law, and of all kind of curſes theatened againſt the diſobedient and rebellious.</p>
               <p>But beſide theſe kinds of teſtimonies there were other proofs alledged, which did ſet forth the generall curſe apart by it ſelf, and likewiſe the generall bleſsing.</p>
               <p>Such as are concerning the curſe, Hoſh. 4.1.2.3. &amp; Heb 2.2.</p>
               <p>And concerning the bleſsing, Pſal. 19.11. and Luke chap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>After this manifold declaration of the curſe and bleſsing we came to the proofe of our generall corruption and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we haue made our ſelues void of the bleſsing,

               </p>
               <p>What proofes were they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are ſuch as we reade, Pſalm.</hi> 14. <hi>and Rom. chapter</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>and ſo forth to the</hi> 21. <hi>verſe, and verſe</hi> 23. <hi>There is no difference: all haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glorie of God.

               <p>To this purpoſe alſo was rehearſed a declaration of the ſpeeches, which vſually all ſuch as be not renued and ſanctified by Gods grace, do caſt forth, both generally and particularly, in contradiction to the righteouſnes of the whole Law, and of euerie Commaundement of it.</p>
               <p>When obedience to the Law of God is generally vrged, why ſay ſome, do ye thinke that none ſhall be ſaued, but ſuch as ſhall liue ſo holily as you would make vs beleeue we muſt? I warrant you there ſhall be but a few ſaued then, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VVe are no Angels ſay ſome: I am no Saint ſaith another: I cannot liue ſo ſtreight a life ſaith the third: I ſhould dy quickly if I ſhold want my merry paſtims, my pleaſant copeſmates, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The like are the particular contradictions which were reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning wicked ſpeeches againſt the righteouſneſſe and obedience of euerie Commaundement.</p>
               <p>After theſe things did follow on the contrarie, the generall proofes of the perfect obedience of our Sauiour Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all that do truely beleeue in him, and repent of their ſinnes, be deliuered from the curſes, and made partakers of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: can you now call to mind which they were?</p>

               <p>Hereof God the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe giueth a moſt ſolemne teſtimonie at his Baptiſme from heauen ſaying, This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed. Matth. 3.17. and againe chap. 17.5. at his tranſfiguration. And the ſame 2. Pet. 1.17.18. Reade alſo the teſtimonie of Iohn the Euangeliſt, 1. Epiſt. 3.5. and of the Apoſtle Peter, 1. Epiſt. 2.22. and of the Apoſtle Paul, 2. Cor. 5.21. and in the Epiſtle to the Hebr. chap. 7.26. Finally, it is in many places teſtified, as we haue alreadie ſeene, that he is called the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: yea euen in his childhood he ſaith to his mother &amp; Ioſeph, Knew ye not that I muſt be about my fathers buſines? Luke 2.49. And at his Baptiſme: It becommeth vs to fulfil all righteouſneſſe, Matth. chap. 3.15. VVe are now come to call to remembrance that which was deliuered from our text, as it followeth after the words of the Law, from the 18. verſe of our 20. chap. of Exodus to the 21. verſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, I wold haue you make rehearſall of the words of the text: VVhich are they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immediatly after the publiſhing of the words of the Law, it followeth thus in our text:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the people ſaw the thunders, and the lightenings, and the ſound of the trumpet, and the mountaine ſmoking, and when the people ſaw it they fled and ſtoode a farre off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſaid vnto Moſes, Talke thou with vs, and we will heare: but let not God talke with vs leſt we dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Moſes ſaid vnto the people, feare ye not: for God is come to proue you, and that his feare might be before you, that ye ſinne not. So the people ſtood a farre off, but Moſes drew neare vnto the darkeneſſe where God vvas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What were you taught to obſerue and mark fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We vvere taught to obſerue theſe three things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, in hovv glorious and fearefull a manner God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and publiſhed his moſt vviſe, righteous, and holy Lavv.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:182:156"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, what effects followed hereupon by God his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd ſavv the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, to what end &amp; purpoſe God gaue his Lavv in ſo feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> manner according to that inſtruction vvhich Moſes (gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy Ghoſt) deliuereth vnto them, according to the occaſion vvhich God himſelfe had giuen by that former vvorke of his in the hearts of all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is plainely expreſſed in the former part of the 18. verſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond followeth in the latter part of the ſame verſe, and in the 19. verſe next following.</p>
               <p>The third is contained in the 20. verſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in the 21. verſe the concluſion of this moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and ſolemne action is ſet downe. For the people go to their tents, as we may perceiue by that which we reade, Deut. chap. 5. verſe 30. But Moſes draweth neare, and abideth with God in the mount fortie daies and fortie nights, to receiue the Law written in the tables of the Couenant, and to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in all the ordinances of God, as it followeth in the 31. verſe of the ſame fift chapter, and as we reade againe in the ſame booke of Moſes, chap. 9. verſes 9.10.11.12.</p>
               <p>And finally, from the conſideration of all theſe things, the generall vſes which we our ſelues are to make of our hearing of the doctrine of the Law were opened vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, let vs now as briefly as we can call to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and ſo will we conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt therfore, why did the Lord publiſh his Law in ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and fearefull a manner: that is to ſay, with terrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightening, &amp;c. according as it is more fully ſet downe in the 19. chapter of Exodus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſavv it to be neceſſarie, partly becauſe of the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnneſſe and pride of mans nature, vvherein it is to be humbled: and partly becauſe of the ſluggiſh drovvſineſſe of the ſame: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vvhereof, the conſcience is to be rovvzed vp, and avvake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to attend to the hearing of the Lavv and doctrine of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is verie true: for this is generally the naturall corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not onely of the Iſraelites, but alſo of all mankind, both
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:182:156"/> Iewes and Gentiles at all times, whoſoeuer they, or we,<note place="margin">Why God gaue his Law in ſo glorious and fearefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> or any other be, or haue bene, euer ſince the firſt fall of man: we are either ſtubburne, proud, and preſumptuous to do euill: or if by ſome ſeruile reſtraint we be not ſo audacious and bold, then are we ſottiſh as it were, and altogether careleſſe to mind or worke any thing that is good.</p>
               <p>Now therfore the Lord in his excellent wiſedome, choſe the fitteſt meanes that might be in either reſpect: euen the ſame alreadie mentioned, which do moſt liuely and effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glorious power and reuerend maieſtie of God, and that he is one moſt perfectly armed and furniſhed from heauen to take vengeance vpon the whole world, and euerie one ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whoſoeuer ſhall deſpiſe and treade vnder foote the leaſt of his Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which he giueth with ſoueraigne charge to be perfectly obeyed of all men, according to that we reade, 2. Corinth. 3.7. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt point.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, what effects followed hereupon in the hearts of all the people of Iſraell, by the Lords owne immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ordering of the matter? For (as it is ſaid) all the people did behold this feareful ſight, and heard both the words of the Law, and alſo the voice of the thunder and ſound of the trumpet. It was a thing done before all the thouſands of Iſraell, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe ſixe hundreth and three thouſand and fiue hundred and fiftie, which were from twentie yeares of age and vpward, Numbers 1.45.46. beſide thoſe eight thouſand fiue hundred and foureſcore of the tribe of Leui, which were numbred from thirtie yeares of age and aboue, Numb. chap. 4.48. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all that were vnder theſe ages, both men-children and men-ſeruants: and beſide all the women-kind, euen ſo manie as were of age to make vſe of the ſight and hearing of theſe things. For theſe alſo were gathered together as it is like, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces further remoued: according as afterward they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, both men, women, and children, and ſtraungers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo among Iſraell, to come together euerie ſeuenth yeare at the feaſt of Tabernacles, to heare the reading of the Law, Deut. 31.10.11.12.13. The practiſe whereof, we reade Nehem. chap. 8.1.2.3. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:182:157"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The effects of the publiſhing of the Law in the hearing of the Iſraelites.</note>VVhat effects therefore I ſay, followed vpon this ſo reuerend and ſolemne an action by the Lords owne more immediate ordering of the matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe effects were three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, they vvere vpon the ſudden vtterly aſtoniſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed vvith a verie terrible feare, as is declared by their flying avvay farre off from the mountaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, vpon aduiſement and counſell vvhen they had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered themſelues, they vvith one conſent acknovvledging the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of inſtruction, but finding themſelues vnable to learne from ſuch a fearefull maner of teaching from the mouth of the Lord, vvhereby they vvere terrified rather then taught; they do by their Elders make their ſute vnto Moſes, that he vvould be a meanes that God vvould no more ſpeake to them after that ſort, but that he vvould teach them by his miniſterie, vvhich they had found by former experience to be more comfortable and fit for them, becauſe of their vveakeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, they promiſe vvilling obedience to Moſes, in all things, vvhich it ſhold pleaſe God to ſpeake vnto them by him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as if God ſhould ſpeake himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe three effects is mentioned in the latter part of the 18. verſe, in theſe words: VVhen the people ſaw it, they fled and ſtood a farre off.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond point, we ſee the whole declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in the 5. chap. of Deut. from the 23. verſe, &amp;c. to the 30. wherein is ſet forth vnto vs, a notable ground for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the holy miniſterie of the word by men, as of that which is come in ſtead of Gods ſpeaking by his own voice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you heareth me. And on the contrarie, he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me. Luke 10.16.</p>
               <p>And concerning the third point, as it is the laſt, ſo it is as the ſealing vp of the reſt.</p>
               <p>For it were to litle fruite, either for Iſraell, or for England, or any of vs, to ſee our ignorance and neceſſitie of inſtruction, and alſo to deſire to enioy the preaching of the word, vnleſſe we ſhould haue grace to obey it.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:182:157"/>
               <p>Thus hauing ſeene what effects followed the Lords feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full publiſhing of his Law,<note place="margin">Moſes teacheth the Iſraelites what vſes they ought to make of the Law.</note> according to his owne immediate working in the hearts of his people; it remaineth that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the laſt point of the firſt anſwer, that we may more particularly conſider from the inſtruction of Moſes, to what ends and purpoſes it pleaſed God to giue his Law in ſo feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a manner.</p>
               <p>What are thoſe ends and purpoſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes comforting the people againſt their exceſſiue feare, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to vnderſtand, that God did not mind by that his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exanimate and amaze them, but rather firſt of all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine or try and proue them, that is, to ſhew them by ſenſible and plaine demonſtration from their owne experience, how fraile and ſinfull creatures they were in and of themſelues, without his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, he telleth them that Gods meaning was by that meanes to ſettle his true reuerence and feare in the hearts of their poſterity for euer, Deut. chap.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp; chap.</hi> 31.11.12.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, that as a fruite of the ſame his true feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they (hauing the knowledge of his Law and will) might be nourtured and preſerued from all witting and willing ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a true and ſhort interpretation of the ſpeech of Moſes to the people of Iſrael. Concerning euery of theſe points, ſundry things were deliuered for a more full inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the which time will not ſerue to repeate.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore come to the generall vſes which we are to make of our owne hearing of the ſame Law of God, vnleſſe we will be vnprofitable hearers of it: yea, vnleſſe we will heare it to our curſe and condemnation, and not to our bleſſing and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Shew you which thoſe vſes are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are ſome which we may call the former vſes: and there be other which we may call the latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which are they which we may call the former?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are theſe which follow.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, it is as a Schoole-maiſter to bring vs to Chriſt, that we might be made righteous by faith, through the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and by the imputation of his righteouſneſſe: and that being deliuered from all wrath and miſery, yea, from euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, whith either the Law or our owne ſinne and corruption offereth, we may be heires of bleſſing here, and of life euerlaſting in the kingdome of heauen.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are the former vſes of the Law, concerning the which we are to vnderſtand, that as in the bodily ſickneſſe, ſo in the ſickneſſe of the ſoule and cure thereof, theſe three things are neceſſary.</p>

               <p>And thirdly, that the medicine being found out, it be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily vſed and applied.</p>
               <p>Firſt therfore, that the Law of God maketh knowne our ſin, which is both the ſickneſſe and alſo the cauſe of the ſickneſſe of the ſoule, reade Gal. 3.19. &amp; Rom. 3.19.20. &amp; chap. 17.7. and verſe 13. Reade alſo how our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by the worke of his Spirit, with this vſe of the Law, Iohn chap. 7. verſe 7. and chap. 16. verſes 8.9.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond vſe, it is moſt anſwerable to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, that the ſame Law which is the meanes of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering ſinne, ſhould alſo make knowne the penalty and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:182:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> which point, you may remember how it was declared vnto you, that the faithfull do find in Chriſt all ſufficient comfort againſt euery diſcomfort which the Law confirmeth againſt vs: ſeeing we do by faith find in him both purity of nature, and righteouſneſſe of life, and ſatisfaction for ſinne, and interceſſion with God on our behalfe, and therewithal power againſt ſinne, and grace to liue righteouſly in ſome meaſure of true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God: and finally euerlaſting life and glory, through the moſt free and infinite mercies of God. To him therefore be all praiſe and honour and glory for euermore, Amen.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to thoſe which were called the latter vſes of the Law.</p>
               <p>Which are they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt vſe of the Law, after that we are brought by it to our Sauiour Chriſt, is that henceforth it is vnto all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, a moſt perfect rule to teach and admoniſh vs how we are to amend our former wicked wayes, and to order and frame our liues anew, in all the duties of true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, to the glorifying of the name of God, to the aſſuring vnto our ſelues the truth of our faith, for the peace of our owne conſciences, and to the good example and profit one of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, it ſerueth as a continuall watch-man and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to tell vs of our faults, that by the rebukes thereof we may be more and more humbled in the ſight of God: and likewiſe, to ſhew vs the imperfection, and manifold failings of our obedience, yea, euen in the beſt things which we do; that ſo it may be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiue againſt all falſe opinion of the worthineſſe and merit of our owne workes, and as a ſpurre to ſtirre vs vp to the care of better proceedings, as hauing bene hitherto vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, it is a perpetuall remembrance vnto vs, how great our deliuerance hath bene by our Sauior Chriſt, who hath freed vs from infinite ſinnes, and from the moſt horrible damnation due to the ſame, to the end that by the ſame continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, we do prouoke our owne harts to loue Chriſt more and more dearely all the dayes of our liues: and therewithall alſo, to put vs in mind how infinite the danger is, if at any time we ſhould fall away from him.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe latter vſes of the Law, reade 1. Tim. 1.5.6.7.8.9.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect alſo, doth our Sauiour Chriſt returne all that are brought to him by the Law for their redemption, iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaluation, backe againe to the Law, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their life, in all the duties of loue both to God and their neighbour, as to the end of their redemption. And ſo alſo do his holy Apoſtles. Reade Ioh. chap. 13.34. &amp; 1. Epiſt. 2.7.8.9.10.11. Rom. 13.8.9.10. Gal. 5.14. and Iames chap. 2.8.9.10.11. Luke 1.74.75. Neither is there any other knowledge of God, faith, feare, loue, &amp;c. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the Goſpell to any Chriſtian and true beleeuer, which was not before comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the Law of God, to euery faithfull and beleeuing Iew.</p>
               <p>And that the duties of Gods morall Law are the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from whence the truth of our faith is to be manifeſted to the glory of God, &amp;c. reade againe Iames chap. 2.14 15.16. &amp;c. and Iohn 3.17.18.19.20.21.22. and Matth. 5.16.17.18.19. &amp;c. Reade alſo Ier. 31.33. compared with Heb. 7.10. and chapter. 10.15.16.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond of theſe latter vſes of the Law, that it ſerueth in ſtead of a continuall watch, &amp;c. call to mind that which we reade, Pſal. 19.11. Moreouer by them is thy ſeruant made circumſpect. Reade alſo Pſal. 119.98. and verſe 205. and Prou. 6.23. And touching our vnprofitableneſſe, reade Luke chap. 17.7.8.9.10. And againſt truſt in our owne works, chap. 18.9.10.11.12.13.14. and verſe 18.19. &amp;c. 23.24.25.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the laſt of the latter vſes of the Law, it is euident to be ſo, in that it doth alwayes rebuke the leaſt ſinne, and in the owne nature continually calleth for perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, vnder paine of the curſe and damnation. Whereby it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh the conſcience to the continuall ſight of the guiltineſſe of ſinne, &amp;c. whence alſo we cannot but be put in mind conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of our deliuerance by our Sauiour Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of that loue and duty which we owe him.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee that the Law is of manifold vſe, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after that we are brought vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But againſt the latter vſes, ſome man will peraduenture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that which the Apoſtle Paule ſeemeth to write to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:182:159"/> euen there where he teacheth, that the Law is our Schoole-maiſter to bring vs to Chriſt: for he addeth theſe words by and by in the very next verſe, Gal. 3.25. But after that faith is come (ſaith he) we are no longer vnder a Schoole-maiſter. And chap. 4.7. Thou art no more a ſeruant but a ſonne and verſe 24. The Law gendreth vnto bondage: and 1. Tim. 1.9. The Law is not giuen to a righteous man.</p>
               <p>To theſe places we anſwere by a true interpretation of the Apoſtles meaning, that they make nothing againſt any of the vſes of the Law by vs mentioned. For his meaning is onely to ſhew, that as the Law is oppoſed to Chriſt &amp; the couenant of grace, and as it bringeth with it the burthen of ceremonies, &amp; as it is armed with the curſe againſt the leaſt tranſgreſſion of it: ſo are not the faithfull (who are redeemed by Chriſt, and do truly indeuour to liue righteouſly) vnder the Law, but vnder grace. But to be vnder the Law for the direction of our liues, how we ſhould ſerue and pleaſe God; this is ſo farre from a bondage, that it is a ſingular eaſe and benefit, that we haue ſo ſhort and perfect an abridgement of the whole will of God as his Law is.</p>
               <p>This is the loue of God (ſaith the Apoſtle Iohn 1. Epiſtle chap. 5.3.) that we keepe his Commandemens; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are not grieuous, that is, they are not ouer-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome vnto true and faithfull Chriſtians. Like as our Sauior Chriſt had ſayd before: My yoake is eaſie, and my burthen is light, Math. 11.30. The reaſon is, becauſe in Chriſt, and through the redemption which he hath paide for our ſinnes, to appeaſe the wrath of God, both the Law and the Goſpell are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they conſent together as in a moſt friendly league, teaching one and the ſame doctrine of faith and godlineſſe, to the glory of God, and the ſaluation of all his elect people. And thus the Law aſwell as the Goſpell is ſaid to conuert the ſoule, to giue wiſedome to the ſimple, to reioyce the heart, &amp;c. as we reade in the 19. Pſal. And thus alſo the righteouſneſſe of God, though it be made manifeſt without the Law, yet it hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law, &amp; of the Prophets. Neither doth the Goſpell make the Law of no effect, but confirmeth and eſtabliſheth it, as the Apoſtle Paule teacheth, Rom. 3. verſe 21. and 31. and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:182:160"/> Gal. 3.21. Is the Law againſt the promiſe of God? God forbid.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we keeping our ſelues farre from the hereſie of thoſe that are called Antinomians, becauſe they vtterly reiect the Law, yea, euen the morall Commandements of the Law of God: let vs in the feare of God, and with all thankes to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty, for ſo great a bleſſing as his Law is (it being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully vſed, as the ſame Apoſtle teacheth, 1. Tim. 1.8.) Let vs I ſay, imbrace and practiſe euery good vſe of it: that is, that we being truly humbled and brought to our Sauiour Chriſt by it, and through him being deliuered from euery curſe of it, we may againe by our Sauiour Chriſt be ſo lifted vp with the ioy of his ſaluation, and ſo ſanctified and enabled by his grace, that walking in obedience to it, we may be partakers of all the bleſſings which God of his infinite mercy though Ieſus Chriſt hath promiſed to the obedience of the ſame; yea, euen to the ſincere, though vnperfect obedience of all ſuch as are redeemed, iuſtified, and ſanctified, through faith in the ſame our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne. The which graces God of the ſame his infinite mercy, graunt vnto vs and to all his elect children, both now and hencefoorth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore, Amen. <gap reason="foreign">
